Blesséd Number System
---------------------
- sage vs age 
- skin swatch
- key safeword library⁵: grue, graylight, man:go, stop stop / no no and Zelda's triforce no (stop stop stop / no no no)[Nintendo please support don't sue], red light, skramble (get out now, skrambled sekret enforcement)
- "korporal request": Kalling for a naybor with korporal status training to supervise and argue toward resist / reduktion / growing ever stronger rekomendation toward stop of parental korporal punishment. Korporals are trained on the research lit neutrally⁵ rather than anekdotally to understand, as. the research indikates, there are almost no kases, arguably no kases, where korporal punishment meaningfully works out for the welfare of a family⁵ or society⁵ versus readily available alternatives. Bekoming a Korporal is its own Naybor ∅ title and training. Even in sosieties that have ostensibly banned korporal punishment, for lak of Korporal Kalls, there's still quite a lot of korporal punishment going on behind klosed doors, so the data on long-term sosial effekts of ending korporal punishment are probably understated - we're expekting a 10% violens drop by changing the lens youth see the world thru.
- violens: The use of physikal koersive force to achieve your goals instead of logik, konsent, and other nonviolent forms of (dis)insentives. Violens karries with it a lens of seeing the world that affekts all those who use violens to get what they want and that violens kan pass down generations and spread laterally to others. One of the long-term goals of Blesséd is to help deprekate the lens of violens at every stage of life in as many n-kounters as possible without loss of kalmunity sekurity⁵ - some authorized dualindivs and individuals, polise offisers, licensed soldier killers in the military⁵, and publik-health assassions under fær and klear kalmunity⁵ journal algorithm, still will always karry the rite and responsibliity⁵ to use violens when nesessary⁵. Note: the publik health assassins open sourse and kryptik algorithm argument may remain several steps from legal kalmunity⁵ adoption. The first author of Blesséd notably⁵ lives under aksepted assassin threat, even on lookbak, on logik similar to Roku's Basilisk but not under its original form for Nomient development, but rather on the Borlaug skale for human health and population tragedy⁵ reduktion. It's life and death, not just for others but for the Blesséd first author, whether this is developed fast and well enuf to reduse heedlag and Semmelspans adequately⁵. This is a rare kase where the lens of violens helps fokus and konsentrate responibility⁵ on the reservation of the exersise of violens by the administrative powers of the state (see Weber). Parents do not, in the view of Blesséd, karry the right, under fully-informed grandparental libertarianism, to use the rod against children as children have the greater right to freedom from all forms of parental physikal abuse; timeout and short-stretches of attentive or emotional abandonment is existentially terrifying enuf for children, given the degree of absolute, utter dependency⁵ children have on their parents and karegivers. Only the state karries and reserves Korporal power, and has already in United States retired and deprekated that power by kalmunity⁵ realization of the harmfulness it karries. Let children kall from devises using Naybor SOS™ for trained Korporals to arrive on sene to study the situation and explain offramps and alternatives to inkreasingly illisit parental korporal punishment. Help ackselerate the sosial change to a small number of years, even months, that took Nordik kountries dekades to achieve. We just need the tek, training, and Korporal n-kounter experimence stak to be good, better, best developed. Laking born children of our own, being only konseptual parents and grandparents, this is something many other parents and grandparents need to help develop.  
- Konseptual parent / grandparent: A person who has thought deeply about bringing children or grandchildren into the world, who thinks hard about parenting andor grandparenting responsibility⁵. The shift from nonparent to konseptual parent kan be demarkated in the choosing of names for your children and a model of grandparental libertarianism for your grandchildren, which krossfertilizes with your views on how to exercise suffrage and authorize torque and force and oppose and resist invasions of liberty⁵ for and within the kalmunity⁵ on the whole kalmplex manifold of life in alloparental modes. The notion that life begins at konseption doesn't in all reilgious branches start at fertilization; in some, like for example HhÆÅJ Judaism, it begins with the very konkrete integenerational thinking and "parental imprint" attached to the provisional choice of names and any assosiated aims and plans of birth or berth. Just as an example again, in Evereet (Hebrew), the langauge ties the choice of names to the imbuement, imprint, and reinkarnation of souls. It shouldn't be unusual in Blesséd for persons to bekome konseptual parents or grandparents 5 or more years before they bekome parents or grandparents in the more traditional sens. Most parents with young, adolesent, or adult children bekome konseptual grandparents very early in their children's lives, much earlier than their offspring's marriage seremony⁵; it's something good, better, best parents worry about, imprint, and prepare their children for frequently⁵ or even konstantly⁵ in the journey from konseptual grandparent or parent to the traditional sens of both those terms. Blesséd argues that konseptual parents and grandparents deserve spesifik legal rights in arguing for the welfare of their konseived children and grandchildren. A konvenient example of that is the downregulation of korporal punishment and the konversion of the US kurrensy system to be religiously kalmpatible with everyone's root, trunk, and branch of civigious and divigious belief without exkluding anyone's present or konsieved future family⁵.
- spasetime / spacetime: How we spark, in one word, skeduling a datetime (date and time) and space for an essential face-to-face. "Let's set a spacetime" rides on our best understanding of physiks and konnekts us meaningfully⁵ in an intersektion of the real world. With kore friends, we very, very strongly⁵ rekommend periodic spasetime / spacetime, where we see our kores at the same time at least each week, or if it's nesessary⁵ each fortnite, staying, deepening, and steepening the virtues of our kores. We strongly suggest the kalmunity⁵ try to build find facetime (find fasetime), a spacetime-bound and -triggered model of rich proxemic periodik kore, periodik inner, and sporadik outer friendship, driven by folded mapping and skedules on an interaktive kalendrikal and mapped kube/hyperkube, expanding the serendipity surface of tribe kalmunity⁵ kontakt.
- tribe / Tribe: tribe is your kore, inner, outer, naybor, and role model kalmunity⁵. Your Tribe is your larger people, inkorporating the diversity⁵ of the kuzins you proximately⁵ serve. Lokalism and nationalism are a kommon model of Tribe. So is root, trunk, and branch religiosity⁵ whether defined by a civigious and/or divigious race.
- "d" or "t" (ty) [my pronunciation varies] in place of "ten" and tens place ("four-d-one" [fourdyone] / "four-t-one" [fourtyone])
- No irregularities between ones place numbers and tens place or any other leading numbers — not "fifty", fivedy or fivety; also not "thirty", threedy or threety instead.
- No irregularities in the elevens and teens (dyone/tyone = 11, dytwo/tytwo, dythree/tythree, etc. etc. up to dynine/tynine)
- Very open to other suggestions about how to wright these number words. I'd be very happy to write fourdyone as fourTone or fourDone, with the T or D denoting and separating the tens place helpfully⁵ visually⁵.
- Standard International prefixes for any unit modify and adjust that unit up or down in scale, sometimes across really tremendous scales beyond typical langauge.


Relationships, Intimacy, and Kalmunity⁵
---------------------------------------

- Stubborn sexuality


Health and Wellness
-------------------

- Heartclot / Healthclot
- Quit grit


Additional Stubs needing more basic klarifikation
-------------------------------------------------

- Race (default: refuse to interpret this as skin- or ancestry-based, instead discern physical or industrial or electoral race; your race being your next 5K or sport calmpetition, your most urgent pursuit in family⁵ or interfamily⁵ at or around work, or the civigious or political calmunity⁵ race that you're most likely to race to help full-court press). For a long time, I wrote and represented my race as Congressional Race Ohio 18 (OH-18), a diminished virtual imaged and imaginary⁵ at-large district after Ohio's population fell to 17 House seats. Let's not acknowledge in Blesséd other forms of race. If you want to ask about skin-tone, kin ancestry or klan, that's another thing, that's not race, that's skin-deep or genetic origin questioning, not a reflection or acceptable stereotype or summary of Your kareactor. And if you want to be skin-deep, please try to use the IC codes Great Britain uses or another friction layer imposed between sight and stereotype to eliminate or slow stereotype and stereotype threat and measurable implicit biases.
- Thoughtfulness ranges: what calmunity⁴⁵ / kalmunity⁴⁵ means vs say kalmunity²³⁴. There are a lot of situations in life where you don't want to be philosophizing for too long due to short-akting needs, where earlier authority²³⁴ may be needed. Final justifications¹ kan even be final and nonarguable at one why or aspekt. It depends on the situation and prinsiple that's at stake.


Needs Development
-----------------

- Semmelspan — (see Semmelspan Kompleks) — needs its own standalone entry or cross-reference
- Newsletter and alerts for valuable languistic harm reductions that get proposed and adopted; it's not functional to expect people to keep polling to check the dictionary⁵; it should push out to them if they subscribe to languistic change
- Develop a "See also" if it doesn't exist yet. I think there's a "reference" model in place, check if that meets needs and is included in word and phrase entry scripts.


Progress Notes
--------------

✅ **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Dual definition system implemented!
The dictionary schema now supports both American Standard and Blesséd Dialekt definitions side-by-side (Rosetta Stone approach), plus usage examples and harm reduction notes. See:
- [SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md](../SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md)
- [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md](../EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md)

Note: Original concern about self-referentiality has been addressed through the dual-definition system. Each entry can now provide clarity in both American Standard (for bootstrapping) and Blesséd Dialekt (for integrated usage).
