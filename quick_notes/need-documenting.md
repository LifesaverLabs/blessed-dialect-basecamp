Blesséd Number System
---------------------

- Blesséd number system
    - sev instead of two-syllable seven
    - ro instead of two-syllable zero, clearly distinguishable from the letter "O" (see logic of Crockford's Base 32)
    - "d" or "t" (ty) [my pronunciation varies] in place of "ten" and tens place ("four-d-one" [fourdyone] / "four-t-one" [fourtyone])
    - No irregularities between ones place numbers and tens place or any other leading numbers — not "fifty", fivedy or fivety; also not "thirty", threedy or threety instead.
    - No irregularities in the elevens and teens (dyone/tyone = 11, dytwo/tytwo, dythree/tythree, etc. etc. up to dynine/tynine)
    - Very open to other suggestions about how to wright these number words. I'd be very happy to write fourdyone as fourTone or fourDone, with the T or D denoting and separating the tens place helpfully⁵ visually⁵.
    - "han" or "hun" for the two-syllable hundred. I prefer "han" over "hun" for this out of gratitude for the Han Zhongguoren (Chinese people), who came up with this beautifully simple foundational counting system I'm copying so heavily⁵ from
    - "thou" instead of the two-syllable thousand
    - "mill" instead of the three-syllable million (this I'm unsettled on, it's very up for debate)
    - "bill" instead of the three-syllable billion (thhis I really like, because it maps to Calmunity⁵ Legislative Bills we coordinate influential incentives and sometimes, when strictly required, coercive action around)
    - Standard International prefixes for any unit modify and adjust that unit up or down in scale, sometimes across really tremendous scales beyond typical langauge.
        - So for instance, a µbill would be one-millionth of a bill or billion, so in the 1,000ish territory. This is useful sometimes for some kommon (common) expressive units like currency where scales jump around so much it's sometimes helpful to think in SI prefix to more easily relate the number gaps with less cognitive overhead over how separated the numbers are. If an Action is an effort that may affect a Borlaug bill (billion) of people, then a milliaction, µaction, and nano-action are more clear to those trained to quickly recognize scale shifts in SI than the equivalent unprefixed langauge. You can do the same thing with currency to make statements like, "I just reached dimillionaire / dimillaire status - I can change my fokus" or "She's a dekamillionaire / dekamillaire — she's reached and launched beyond ever-accelerating eskape velocity".
- dekas (dekamillionaires in American / US currency models — a substantially different species of wealth beyond millaire / millionaire that requires a word label, especially since a deka as of wrighting today at end of 02025 is equivalent to a millaire / millionare from 01966 - the klassikal 01960s word millionaire should be rereferenced deka today). At the deka level almost no one today⁵ with reasonable wants and needs wouldn't accelerate year over year thru kompounding like a plasma engine to "litespeed" and "litening" intergenerational experiences
- hektos (hektomillionaires in American / US currency models). Someone in the class of wealth of hundred+ mill is in the "hekto" wealth category⁵. Hektos with liquidity are unbelievably⁵ flexibly⁵ free if they're medically healthy⁵ and wish to be.

- limerance (exists in American but not well-known)

Life Planning and Economics

- frupidity (borrowed and copied from the lexicon of Amazon); frugality⁵ is a kore klassikal virtue, frupidity is its inverse where rekless frugality⁵ kauses unnecessary⁵ pennywise, pound-foolish suffering. Not offering national freely available convenient Basic Life Support training to everyone everywhere in the developed world is an example of fiscal frupidity that's killing millions of people.
- one-way door (also borrowed from the lexicon of Amazon):

Additional Stubs needing more basic klarifikation
-------------------------------------------------

- Race (default: refuse to interpret this as skin- or ancestry-based, instead discern physical or industrial or electoral race; your race being your next 5K or sport calmpetition, your most urgent pursuit in family⁵ or interfamily⁵ at or around work, or the civigious or political calmunity⁵ race that you're most likely to race to help full-court press). For a long time, I wrote and represented my race as Congressional Race Ohio 18 (OH-18), a diminished virtual imaged and imaginary⁵ at-large district after Ohio's population fell to 17 House seats. Let's not acknowledge in Blesséd other forms of race. If you want to ask about skin-tone, kin ancestry or klan, that's another thing, that's not race, that's skin-deep or genetic origin questioning, not a reflection or acceptable stereotype or summary of Your kareactor. And if you want to be skin-deep, please try to use the IC codes Great Britain uses or another friction layer imposed between sight and stereotype to eliminate or slow stereotype and stereotype threat and measurable implicit biases.
- Thoughtfulness ranges: what calmunity⁴⁵ / kalmunity⁴⁵ means vs say kalmunity²³⁴. There are a lot of situations in life where you don't want to be philosophizing for too long due to short-akting needs, where earlier authority²³⁴ may be needed. Final justifications¹ kan even be final and nonarguable at one why or aspekt. It depends on the situation and prinsiple that's at stake.


Needs Development
-----------------

- Newsletter and alerts for valuable languistic harm reductions that get proposed and adopted; it's not functional to expect people to keep polling to check the dictionary⁵; it should push out to them if they subscribe to languistic change
- Develop a "See also" if it doesn't exist yet. I think there's a "reference" model in place, check if that meets needs and is included in word and phrase entry scripts.


Progress Notes
--------------

✅ **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Dual definition system implemented!
The dictionary schema now supports both American Standard and Blesséd Dialekt definitions side-by-side (Rosetta Stone approach), plus usage examples and harm reduction notes. See:
- [SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md](../SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md)
- [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md](../EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md)

Note: Original concern about self-referentiality has been addressed through the dual-definition system. Each entry can now provide clarity in both American Standard (for bootstrapping) and Blesséd Dialekt (for integrated usage).

✅ KB (knowledge base ⇌ keyboard schema lock) - **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Keyboard Layout (KB) system implemented with versioning, known issues tracking, and integration with Knowledge Base. See [DICTIONARY_SYSTEM.md - Keyboard Layouts section](../DICTIONARY_SYSTEM.md#keyboard-layouts-kb-system)

✅ Long Now Years: 02025 instead of 2025 - **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Implemented as standard date format throughout the system. See [PROMPT.md - Date Format Convention](../PROMPT.md)

✅ Unambiguous dates (YYYYY-MM月DD format) - **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Adopted as standard format with 月 character for unambiguous month designation. Big-endian ordering for sortability. See [PROMPT.md](../PROMPT.md)

✅ **COMPLETED 02025-12月26**: Added 26 entries to Digital Diktionary⁵!
