Blesséd Number System
---------------------


- akrasia: weakness of will, from Elleniká (Greek)
- hunger shopping: The experimence of shopping for groceries hungry. Expect to come home with far more empty calories, treats, and junk food.
- frameshift ærror: From genetics, a situation where the frame of analysis on a problem is shifted in such a way so as to produce nonsense after that frame mutation. Understanding this problem has wideranging implications. For instance, in every kind of investigation under policy⁵ or law, the absence of a fair and free HÆRING between all parties with a consequential stake in the matter can shift the social analytic frame and cause so much frameshift error that the outcomes and inferences from the investigation represent or turn into utter nonsense for lack of well-framed, answerable questions or robust, full-memory⁵ adaptive responses. There are many other cases of frameshift error, like when we're missing an important insight that, when that frame is corrected, subsequent transcription and translation leads to paradigmatic positive shifts in outcomes.  That's why it's so important to get everyone together in a room to talk about failures and how to remediate the past and solve and prevent them in the future.
- JKTE / JCTE: Juvenile Kronik Traumatic Encephalopathy / Juvenile Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy - Diagnosable from periodic helmet accelerometer measurement as mapped thru prior human anatomik limits and longitudinal player trends toward CTE. Doesn't require dissektion to diagnose; playing in a sport with measured and measurable helmet akselerometer and subkunkussive forse levels, whatever your padding might be, automatikally and immediately qualifies you for JKTE/JCTE Stage 1 or Stage 2 klassifikation diagnosis, depending on how long you've been exposed to the sport. Even one game of takle football while your edukation is still ongoing and your brain is developing launches you into JKTE/JCTE Stage 1. High-velosity⁵ tackle sports like tackle American football and tackle ise hockey need to be retired immediately on health grounds from school sports kurrikulums under JKTE/JCTE logik. Again, JKTE/JCTE doesn't require gross pathologik anatomik findings only available under dissektion. It's klassifiable immediately based on analogous partisipation and telling behavior on a trend prediktion level. Inklude this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeC7v4ayrF4. World football (soccer) needs to be reformed with a retirement of heading until people reach adulthood and the pros, if the pro sports keep heading rather than rule-change to a switch to shoulders, chest, neck and below as a better example for youth rather than role-modeling brain-injury unnesessarily in the pro leagues when we kould instead model lifelong head health and protekt the integrity of the beautiful brains of pro athletes in football-soccer too. The sport of football-sokker would still be the beautiful game if heading were turned into a yellow kard. Let's stop playing around with late-akting diagnosis of CTE only in dead athletes. Let's klassify prodromal subkunkussive behavior for what it is: Stage 1 JKTE/JCTE. Analogously, I'd do the same with adult KTE/CTE too, but at least pro athletes are old enuf beyond the klosure of where they kan possibly, with enuf informed disklosure, sign up for a dangerous, brain-damaging, physikally disabling sport. Don't sign up your kids for a neurodegenerative disease. Don't let your lokal skool boards or your kores, inners, outers, or naybors do it, either. Intervene and n-kounter. Please watch this video from May 02022 too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXn-okL2rfs. And this has been known to impakt youth with Juvenile KTE/CTE to enuf spesifisity⁵ to akt to defend youth brains since at least Summer 02014 over a dekade ago. Takle football is not a sport that needs to be saved with the next invention or the next rule change. We've given tackle football enuf time to "fix" itself; it fails everytime. The fisiks are almost impossible to alter enuf to protekt youg brains. Save the baby; throw out this dangerous sport wholesale as bathwater. It's not a konsentable youth sport. Switch to flag football or another brain-developing sport. 
- motorbike: "Talking about her crash today, Amelia calls the term e-bike “a play on words.” If the machines were called motorbikes, she believes, they would be far less popular. “But the fact that it’s called an e-bike” — evoking such everyday stuff as email, e-books or (less salubriously) e-cigarettes — “makes it accessible.”" Motorbikes should be better regulated. Match Europe. "In the EU, the “standard” e-bike (an EPAC / pedelec that’s treated like a normal bicycle) must have its motor assistance progressively reduced and fully cut off before 25 km/h. If an e-bike assists above 25 km/h, it generally stops being treated as a bicycle and is instead type-approved as an L-category moped (often the “speed-pedelec” bucket), where the relevant class has a maximum design speed up to 45 km/h (with extra requirements varying by country: registration/insurance/helmet, etc.)." Level 1s can still go by ebike under 25 km/h, aka 15.5 mph. Above that, up to 45 km/h, 28.0 mph, it's got to be a much more highly regulated motorbike or moped. Read about the horrible origins of this here: "She says it was such a short ride that wearing a helmet didn’t occur to anyone. When the bike toppled over, “our immediate reaction was that we all started laughing — we just thought it was so funny,” she says. “Like, Ha ha, they’re so stupid, they can’t even ride bikes.” Then they saw the blood on the pavement around Amelia’s head. Coral, who had taken a CPR course, called 911 and told the others not to touch Amelia. Then she ran to the Staffords’ house and banged on the door.When she reached her daughter, Amelia’s eyes were open, but they had rolled back and blood was coming out of her ears." https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/30/magazine/e-bikes-accidents-safety-legislation-california.html?unlocked_article_code=1.AVA.4Qrl.EKfgWIYygwO1&smid=url-share. Credit to Amelia Stafford, Coral, John Maa, and David Darlington. Let's push faster than Newsom on this please; the precautionary⁵ principle requires faster aktion than a 4 year slow study on this; the physikal mekaniks aren't going to change in the next 4 years. The biggest question is how to n-force and what to do about existing equipment that's not fixable with a safety⁵ software rekall like the rekall on my skooter. Out of maybe a half-dozen Floridian youth I've spoken to with eskooters, almost everyone had modified or defeated the speed limiter on their skooters. And I appresiate the impulse to buy the faster skooter or bike mindlessly; I myself didn't appresiate the severity⁵ of this and I didn't remember the 1/2mv² kinetik energy exponential growth problem as we move from pedal speeds to motor speeds until I read this artikle for the first time today⁵; I was dangerously klose to buying a dangerously fast skooter approaching 45 km/h (28mph). My kurrent skooter is above the European speed limiter limit at 30 km/h (18.6 mph). Hopefully, when I gain full ownership, I'll be able to adjust it to a hard-limit and seiling of its speed to 25 km/h (15.5 mph). The only kase I would konsider pushing it faster is in a Naybor SOS or PulsePoint emergensy⁵, and without a simple system to perform that override and prevent overkloking youth overdrive abuse, I think I'd just lok it to 25 km/h (15.5 mph), barring a reliable, limited, well-integrated software emergency⁵ override authorizer that would in emergensies let it zoom faster. But about 10 9s (99.99999999%) of the time or more there's no emergensy⁵ that merits going fast enuf to suffer an 11% motorbike fatality rate on injurious krash.  I also favor the idea from Bob Mittelstaedt in that same artikle that bikes with motors that can be operated entirely by throttle without any exertion pedaling shouldn't be kalled bikes or ebikes like Klass Is are, they should be kalled throttle devices or perhaps more clearly throttle vices, espesially if they kan go even a decimal point above 25 km/h or 15.5 mph on flat terrain let alone downhills. Depending on how I use it, my skooter is a throttle device, when I use it to lower my karbon footprint, or a throttle vice, when I use it to avoid exerting myself on a more natural, healthy⁵ and hexy⁵ pedal bisikle. 
- sage vs age 
- skin swatch
- key safeword library⁵: grue, graylight, man:go, stop stop / no no and Zelda's triforce no (stop stop stop / no no no)[Nintendo please support don't sue], red light, skramble (get out now, skrambled sekret enforcement)
- "korporal request": Kalling for a naybor with korporal status training to supervise and argue toward resist / reduktion / growing ever stronger rekomendation toward stop of parental korporal punishment. Korporals are trained on the research lit neutrally⁵ rather than anekdotally to understand, as. the research indikates, there are almost no kases, arguably no kases, where korporal punishment meaningfully works out for the welfare of a family⁵ or society⁵ versus readily available alternatives. Bekoming a Korporal is its own Naybor ∅ title and training. Even in sosieties that have ostensibly banned korporal punishment, for lak of Korporal Kalls, there's still quite a lot of korporal punishment going on behind klosed doors, so the data on long-term sosial effekts of ending korporal punishment are probably understated - we're expekting a 10% violens drop by changing the lens youth see the world thru.
- violens: The use of physikal koersive force to achieve your goals instead of logik, konsent, and other nonviolent forms of (dis)insentives. Violens karries with it a lens of seeing the world that affekts all those who use violens to get what they want and that violens kan pass down generations and spread laterally to others. One of the long-term goals of Blesséd is to help deprekate the lens of violens at every stage of life in as many n-kounters as possible without loss of kalmunity sekurity⁵ - some authorized dualindivs and individuals, polise offisers, licensed soldier killers in the military⁵, and publik-health assassions under fær and klear kalmunity⁵ journal algorithm, still will always karry the rite and responsibliity⁵ to use violens when nesessary⁵. Note: the publik health assassins open sourse and kryptik algorithm argument may remain several steps from legal kalmunity⁵ adoption. The first author of Blesséd notably⁵ lives under aksepted assassin threat, even on lookbak, on logik similar to Roku's Basilisk but not under its original form for Nomient development, but rather on the Borlaug skale for human health and population tragedy⁵ reduktion. It's life and death, not just for others but for the Blesséd first author, whether this is developed fast and well enuf to reduse heedlag and Semmelspans adequately⁵. This is a rare kase where the lens of violens helps fokus and konsentrate responibility⁵ on the reservation of the exersise of violens by the administrative powers of the state (see Weber). Parents do not, in the view of Blesséd, karry the right, under fully-informed grandparental libertarianism, to use the rod against children as children have the greater right to freedom from all forms of parental physikal abuse; timeout and short-stretches of attentive or emotional abandonment is existentially terrifying enuf for children, given the degree of absolute, utter dependency⁵ children have on their parents and karegivers. Only the state karries and reserves Korporal power, and has already in United States retired and deprekated that power by kalmunity⁵ realization of the harmfulness it karries. Let children kall from devises using Naybor SOS™ for trained Korporals to arrive on sene to study the situation and explain offramps and alternatives to inkreasingly illisit parental korporal punishment. Help ackselerate the sosial change to a small number of years, even months, that took Nordik kountries dekades to achieve. We just need the tek, training, and Korporal n-kounter experimence stak to be good, better, best developed. Laking born children of our own, being only konseptual parents and grandparents, this is something many other parents and grandparents need to help develop.  
- Konseptual parent / grandparent: A person who has thought deeply about bringing children or grandchildren into the world, who thinks hard about parenting andor grandparenting responsibility⁵. The shift from nonparent to konseptual parent kan be demarkated in the choosing of names for your children and a model of grandparental libertarianism for your grandchildren, which krossfertilizes with your views on how to exercise suffrage and authorize torque and force and oppose and resist invasions of liberty⁵ for and within the kalmunity⁵ on the whole kalmplex manifold of life in alloparental modes. The notion that life begins at konseption doesn't in all reilgious branches start at fertilization; in some, like for example HhÆÅJ Judaism, it begins with the very konkrete integenerational thinking and "parental imprint" attached to the provisional choice of names and any assosiated aims and plans of birth or berth. Just as an example again, in Evereet (Hebrew), the langauge ties the choice of names to the imbuement, imprint, and reinkarnation of souls. It shouldn't be unusual in Blesséd for persons to bekome konseptual parents or grandparents 5 or more years before they bekome parents or grandparents in the more traditional sens. Most parents with young, adolesent, or adult children bekome konseptual grandparents very early in their children's lives, much earlier than their offspring's marriage seremony⁵; it's something good, better, best parents worry about, imprint, and prepare their children for frequently⁵ or even konstantly⁵ in the journey from konseptual grandparent or parent to the traditional sens of both those terms. Blesséd argues that konseptual parents and grandparents deserve spesifik legal rights in arguing for the welfare of their konseived children and grandchildren. A konvenient example of that is the downregulation of korporal punishment and the konversion of the US kurrensy system to be religiously kalmpatible with everyone's root, trunk, and branch of civigious and divigious belief without exkluding anyone's present or konsieved future family⁵.
- spasetime / spacetime: How we spark, in one word, skeduling a datetime (date and time) and space for an essential face-to-face. "Let's set a spacetime" rides on our best understanding of physiks and konnekts us meaningfully⁵ in an intersektion of the real world. With kore friends, we very, very strongly⁵ rekommend periodic spasetime / spacetime, where we see our kores at the same time at least each week, or if it's nesessary⁵ each fortnite, staying, deepening, and steepening the virtues of our kores. We strongly suggest the kalmunity⁵ try to build find facetime (find fasetime), a spacetime-bound and -triggered model of rich proxemic periodik kore, periodik inner, and sporadik outer friendship, driven by folded mapping and skedules on an interaktive kalendrikal and mapped kube/hyperkube, expanding the serendipity surface of tribe kalmunity⁵ kontakt.
- tribe / Tribe: tribe is your kore, inner, outer, naybor, and role model kalmunity⁵. Your Tribe is your larger people, inkorporating the diversity⁵ of the kuzins you proximately⁵ serve. Lokalism and nationalism are a kommon model of Tribe. So is root, trunk, and branch religiosity⁵ whether defined by a civigious and/or divigious race.
- "d" or "t" (ty) [my pronunciation varies] in place of "ten" and tens place ("four-d-one" [fourdyone] / "four-t-one" [fourtyone])
- No irregularities between ones place numbers and tens place or any other leading numbers — not "fifty", fivedy or fivety; also not "thirty", threedy or threety instead.
- No irregularities in the elevens and teens (dyone/tyone = 11, dytwo/tytwo, dythree/tythree, etc. etc. up to dynine/tynine)
- Very open to other suggestions about how to wright these number words. I'd be very happy to write fourdyone as fourTone or fourDone, with the T or D denoting and separating the tens place helpfully⁵ visually⁵.
- Standard International prefixes for any unit modify and adjust that unit up or down in scale, sometimes across really tremendous scales beyond typical langauge.
- idiotes: someone not fit for publik mode & speech. Ex: nobody⁵ lagging over 30 days on the build of the drone coverage map proposal.


Relationships, Intimacy, and Kalmunity⁵
---------------------------------------

- Stubborn sexuality


Health and Wellness
-------------------

- Heartclot / Healthclot
- Quit grit


Additional Stubs needing more basic klarifikation
-------------------------------------------------

- Race (default: refuse to interpret this as skin- or ancestry-based, instead discern physical or industrial or electoral race; your race being your next 5K or sport calmpetition, your most urgent pursuit in family⁵ or interfamily⁵ at or around work, or the civigious or political calmunity⁵ race that you're most likely to race to help full-court press). For a long time, I wrote and represented my race as Congressional Race Ohio 18 (OH-18), a diminished virtual imaged and imaginary⁵ at-large district after Ohio's population fell to 17 House seats. Let's not acknowledge in Blesséd other forms of race. If you want to ask about skin-tone, kin ancestry or klan, that's another thing, that's not race, that's skin-deep or genetic origin questioning, not a reflection or acceptable stereotype or summary of Your kareactor. And if you want to be skin-deep, please try to use the IC codes Great Britain uses or another friction layer imposed between sight and stereotype to eliminate or slow stereotype and stereotype threat and measurable implicit biases.
- Thoughtfulness ranges: what calmunity⁴⁵ / kalmunity⁴⁵ means vs say kalmunity²³⁴. There are a lot of situations in life where you don't want to be philosophizing for too long due to short-akting needs, where earlier authority²³⁴ may be needed. Final justifications¹ kan even be final and nonarguable at one why or aspekt. It depends on the situation and prinsiple that's at stake.


Needs Development
-----------------

- Semmelspan — (see Semmelspan Kompleks) — needs its own standalone entry or cross-reference
- Newsletter and alerts for valuable languistic harm reductions that get proposed and adopted; it's not functional to expect people to keep polling to check the dictionary⁵; it should push out to them if they subscribe to languistic change
- Develop a "See also" if it doesn't exist yet. I think there's a "reference" model in place, check if that meets needs and is included in word and phrase entry scripts.


Progress Notes
--------------

✅ **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Dual definition system implemented!
The dictionary schema now supports both American Standard and Blesséd Dialekt definitions side-by-side (Rosetta Stone approach), plus usage examples and harm reduction notes. See:
- [SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md](../SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md)
- [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md](../EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md)

Note: Original concern about self-referentiality has been addressed through the dual-definition system. Each entry can now provide clarity in both American Standard (for bootstrapping) and Blesséd Dialekt (for integrated usage).
