Words / Phrases that need documenting ASAP, when time becomes available
========================================================================
- krashless / kar
- semmelweis and semmelweis wright, right, and rite
- Blesséd number system
    - sev instead of two-syllable seven
    - ro instead of two-syllable zero, clearly distinguishable from the letter "O" (see logic of Crockford's Base 32)
    - "d" or "t" (ty) [my pronunciation varies] in place of "ten" and tens place ("four-d-one" [fourdyone] / "four-t-one" [fourtyone])
    - No irregularities between ones place numbers and tens place or any other leading numbers — not "fifty", fivedy or fivety; also not "thirty", threedy or threety instead. 
    - No irregularities in the elevens and teens (dyone/tyone = 11, dytwo/tytwo, dythree/tythree, etc. etc. up to dynine/tynine)
    - Very open to other suggestions about how to wright these number words. I'd be very happy to write fourdyone as fourTone or fourDone, with the T or D denoting and separating the tens place helpfully⁵ visually⁵.
    - "han" or "hun" for the two-syllable hundred. I prefer "han" over "hun" for this out of gratitude for the Han Zhongguoren (Chinese people), who came up with this beautifully simple foundational counting system I'm copying so heavily⁵ from
    - "thou" instead of the two-syllable thousand
    - "mill" instead of the three-syllable million (this I'm unsettled on, it's very up for debate)
    - "bill" instead of the three-syllable billion (thhis I really like, because it maps to Calmunity⁵ Legislative Bills we coordinate influential incentives and sometimes, when strictly required, coercive action around)
    - Standard International prefixes for any unit modify and adjust that unit up or down in scale, sometimes across really tremendous scales beyond typical langauge. 
        - So for instance, a µbill would be one-millionth of a bill or billion, so in the 1,000ish territory. This is useful sometimes for some kommon (common) expressive units like currency where scales jump around so much it's sometimes helpful to think in SI prefix to more easily relate the number gaps with less cognitive overhead over how separated the numbers are. If an Action is an effort that may affect a Borlaug bill (billion) of people, then a milliaction, µaction, and nano-action are more clear to those trained to quickly recognize scale shifts in SI than the equivalent unprefixed langauge. You can do the same thing with currency to make statements like, "I just reached dimillionaire / dimillaire status - I can change my fokus" or "She's a dekamillionaire / dekamillaire — she's reached and launched beyond ever-accelerating eskape velocity".

- facemate (proposal for a term for true classical friend, someone we regularly⁵ spend facetime with and mutually⁵ grow with. You're not facemates with people you haven't seen for weeks or months; to be a facemate requires a certain amount of intensive calmunication and a willingness to share personal experiences for critical growth, support, study⁵, eudæmonia, and problemsolving — don't dilute, please don't tolerate marketers like Facebook diluting this term facemate; if you have an app that lists facemates those facemates should fade to being relabeled automatically as acquaintances instead if enuf time passes without true established contact. This is really important for socialization, calmunity⁵ caring, and balancing creative solitude with loneliness, especially untended loneliness, prevention; happy to provide facemate.org to any public benefit or nonprofit that's serious about promoting true, regular friendship under seriously⁵ honest Dunbar limit discussion and classifications - no one on the site should be permitted to have more than 150 facemate contacts, ever, including active acquaintances registered, and in general should be warned and resisted if going beyond Dunbar inner layers; any active acquaintance or facemate additions when you're already at 150 have to be paired with a conscious Dunbar limit acquaintance freeze / inactivity tag / drop; making room for a new facemate or active acquaintance must come at an accepted and acceptable tradeoff cost — it's not possible to be actively acquainted, in a meaningful way, with more than 150 people; influencers and calmunity⁵ connectors / leaders who intimate or suggest otherwise are generally lying or misleading to one degree or another if they act to you like they're a Dunbar friend or facemate [])
- n-counter
- dekas (dekamillionaires in American / US currency models — a substantially different species of wealth beyond millaire / millionaire that requires a word label, especially since a deka as of wrighting today at end of 02025 is equivalent to a millaire / millionare from 01966 - the klassikal 01960s word millionaire should be rereferenced deka today). At the deka level almost no one today⁵ with reasonable wants and needs wouldn't accelerate year over year thru kompounding like a plasma engine to "litespeed" and "litening" intergenerational experiences
- hektos (hektomillionaires in American / US currency models). Someone in the class of wealth of hundred+ mill is in the "hekto" wealth category⁵. Hektos with liquidity are unbelievably⁵ flexibly⁵ free if they're medically healthy⁵ and wish to be.
- frupidity (borrowed and copied from the lexicon of Amazon); frugality⁵ is a kore klassikal virtue, frupidity is its inverse where rekless frugality⁵ kauses unnecessary⁵ pennywise, pound-foolish suffering. Not offering national freely available convenient Basic Life Support training to everyone everywhere in the developed world is an example of fiscal frupidity that's killing millions of people.
- one-way door (also borrowed from the lexicon of Amazon): 
- reverse synth: the process of reverse synthesizing a life or anything else you face or are konsidering creating or synthesizing. Originally⁵ from the planning process of reverse synthesis in the "theory of change", kemistry⁵ (chemistry⁵), where you work backwards from where you want to go, your target, back to your source or present state, and not just forwards to logic your way toward creating whatever you want to create. Sometimes its easier to see the step just before you get married; if that involves a prenup, and if that prenup needs to be decided early enuf for your choice of partner to change, why not reposition to prenup in reverse synthesis to pre-proposal, in anticipation of a ring or thing? Reverse synth is extremely highly encouraged and urged for any major life action or decision, especially major gates like reaching career training, job placement, engagement, and marriage. We want to see more reverse synth in planning and linear life optimization. The proposed Pre30 site is driven by the impulse to help assist with smoothing all the important pitfalls and difficulties of reverse syth "working backward" backward engagement and dating planning logic.
- ring or thing (resisting thotless diamond ring lemming culture; amethyst hearthstone example alternative)
- µdowry (arguably a much more functional and ancient alternative to thotless diamond ring reliance - any ring selection, if You still need or want one and prioritize it as a fungible free spend, can come from fungible µdowry⁵ gift, exercise in responsible couple's future-oriented resource budgeting and bonding — but you should be free to divert the µdowry to anything, from a more experimencial honeymoon (which pays relationship dividends and reduces divorce rates) to an amazing, storyful artifact for your home like skulptural bookshelves where your souls can grow and continuously⁵ reentwine with the unique furnishments of that unique furniture). The original Blesséd author hopes Pre30 breaks and brakes down lemming diamond ring default culture. It's an indefensible waste typically on a lot of levels, especially as costs rise beyond a few han / hun dollars, and higher spending on rings is empirically⁵ correlated with _higher_ divorce rates, not longer marriages as De Beersr misleads you to believe.  It's actually a mark of bad kareactor, not good kareactor, for your partner to buy you a diamond ring, especially an expensive or natural diamong ring, without a super-deep discussion about whether it's the rite way to spend and all the alternatives and life-kompounding differences of those alternatives. There are approximately ro reasons to purchase a natural diamond anymore; all natural diamond sales should kollapse quickly⁵ from lack of any konsumer demand in any wealth kategory⁵. Not to pick on anyone, but the idea of Jeff Bezos buying Lauren Sanchez Bezos a diamond ring is, I assure you, a form of madness to Bezos _and_ Sanchez. Sanchez would have been better off receiving an additional $5 million and deciding for herself how to best spend those super-unusually large milli-dowry⁵ (mdowry⁵) funds. I suspekt she wouldn't have spent on a $5 mill (million) diamond if the funds were transferred to her and it was her free choice on what to spend that dowry⁵ on, even at that supra-stratospheric interplanetary⁵ skale of coupled "hektobill" (hektobillionaire) wealth.  I should note here when bringing up this marriage that if I had to pick a team, I'd certainly⁵ be on Team Scott, especially given the presumptive needs of the children, and separately Scott's utterly record-breaking remarkable "relentless" philanthropy⁵ and unusually⁵ empowering unrestricted-giving philanthropic model, but I really hope for the best for everyone, even in messy situations, and I don't presently⁵ have my hand forced any further than that on needing to moralize over the nature of better and best rings or things.
- "Good, better, best": A childhood rhyme. The traditional version can be improved: instead of the original, teach instead "Good, better, best: Never let them rest. Until the better get [better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213233.Better) and the good get best." In Blesséd, we want others and our facemates and family⁵ to launch past our achievement, performance, and happiness levels calmpetitively⁵. Rising tides raise all boats; let's make the better better and the good best.
- architexture (most of all in the context of choice architexture, where textual reference sources drive calmplex decision-making)
- designer (Buckminster Fuller definition: A designer is an emerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist and evolutionary strategist.)
