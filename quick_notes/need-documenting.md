The Semmelspan Kompleks
-----------------------

_Klaude's / Turk AI's Stunning Draft of the Semmelspan Kompleks_

'''
The Semmelspan Kompleks
A family of terms for translational failure in publik knowledge

Semmelspan /ˈsɛməlspæn/ n.
The kategory of publik tragedy wherein valid, life-saving knowledge is published, ignored, and vindicated only after preventable harm has accumulated. Named for Ignaz Semmelweis (1818–1865), Hungarian physisian who proved handwashing prevented childbed fever, was ridiculed by the medikal establishment, and died in an asylum before germ theory vindicated him.
A semmelspan is not mere delay—it requires: (1) kleer evidens, (2) publik dismissal or suppression, (3) continued preventable harm, and (4) eventual vindikation.

"Climate siens is the longest-running semmelspan in human history."


Heedlag /ˈhiːdlæɡ/ n.
The measurable temporal delay between the moment heeding becomes possible (first kredible publikation) and the moment heeding actually occurs (polisy adoption, behavioral ∆, or praxis shift). The core metrik of translational failure.
Etymology: heed (to pay attention) + lag (delay)

"The heedlag on lead paint was sevty years—from first warnings in the 1900s to federal bans in 1978."


Warnklok /ˈwɔːrnklɒk/ n.
The accountability instrument for tracking a semmelspan in real time or retrospekt. A warnklok is started when kredible warning is first published; split-times are rekorded at each subsequent ignored checkpoint (major studies, aktivist campaigns, near-misses); the klok stops when translational success is achieved.
Etymology: warn + klok (clock)

"Start the warnklok—the first paper just dropped. Future historians will judge every split."

Warnklok split-time /— splɪt taɪm/ n.
A marked moment on the warnklok where translation could have occurred but failed. Each split-time represents a distingkt failure mode: institutional inertia, ekonomik interest, paradigm protekshun, or simple not-listening.

"The 1988 Hansen testimony was a warnklok split-time—Congress heard, understood, and did nothing."


Knowdebt /ˈnoʊdɛt/ n.
The accumulating moral, social, and praktikal debt incurred by knowing and not acting. Knowdebt compounds: each day of heedlag adds to the principal. Interest accrues in preventable deaths, environmental damage, or systemic harm.
Etymology: know + debt
Knowdebt is the ethical dimension of heedlag—the quantifikation of what was owed and not paid.

"The knowdebt on tobakko took fifty years to settle, and we're still paying interest in lung kancer deaths."


Translait /trænsˈleɪt/ n., adj.
The kondition of knowledge that has failed to translate from publikation to praxis; knowledge that arrived late to akshun despite being available early.
Etymology: translate + late (phonetikally embedded)
As adjektive: deskriptive of findings, polisies, or interventions that remain stuck in journals, reports, or activist kleims without praktikal adoption.

"Hand hygiene was translait knowledge for four dekades."
"How many translait findings are sitting in publik health journals wright now?"

The Prekautionary Konnektion
The Semmelspan Kompleks exists in dialektik tension with the prekautionary principle: where the principle asks "what if we're wrong to akt?", the kompleks asks "what if we're wrong to wait?"
Every semmelspan is a failure of prekautionary reasoning—a case where the burden of proof was placed on the warner rather than the harm-causer.
Proper use of the warnklok embeds prekautionary lookback: when we finally akt, we do not simply celebrate—we audit. We klok the split-times, kalkulate the knowdebt, and assign responsibility.

"Vindikation is not exoneration. The warnklok split-times still demand an answer."


In Memoriam
These terms exist so that Ignaz Semmelweis is spoken of whenever the pattern repeats. He died unheeded. The least we owe is to name the tragedy after him—and to start the warnklok earlier next time.

Blesséd Number System
---------------------

- Blesséd number system
    - sev instead of two-syllable seven
    - ro instead of two-syllable zero, clearly distinguishable from the letter "O" (see logic of Crockford's Base 32)
    - "d" or "t" (ty) [my pronunciation varies] in place of "ten" and tens place ("four-d-one" [fourdyone] / "four-t-one" [fourtyone])
    - No irregularities between ones place numbers and tens place or any other leading numbers — not "fifty", fivedy or fivety; also not "thirty", threedy or threety instead.
    - No irregularities in the elevens and teens (dyone/tyone = 11, dytwo/tytwo, dythree/tythree, etc. etc. up to dynine/tynine)
    - Very open to other suggestions about how to wright these number words. I'd be very happy to write fourdyone as fourTone or fourDone, with the T or D denoting and separating the tens place helpfully⁵ visually⁵.
    - "han" or "hun" for the two-syllable hundred. I prefer "han" over "hun" for this out of gratitude for the Han Zhongguoren (Chinese people), who came up with this beautifully simple foundational counting system I'm copying so heavily⁵ from
    - "thou" instead of the two-syllable thousand
    - "mill" instead of the three-syllable million (this I'm unsettled on, it's very up for debate)
    - "bill" instead of the three-syllable billion (thhis I really like, because it maps to Calmunity⁵ Legislative Bills we coordinate influential incentives and sometimes, when strictly required, coercive action around)
    - Standard International prefixes for any unit modify and adjust that unit up or down in scale, sometimes across really tremendous scales beyond typical langauge.
        - So for instance, a µbill would be one-millionth of a bill or billion, so in the 1,000ish territory. This is useful sometimes for some kommon (common) expressive units like currency where scales jump around so much it's sometimes helpful to think in SI prefix to more easily relate the number gaps with less cognitive overhead over how separated the numbers are. If an Action is an effort that may affect a Borlaug bill (billion) of people, then a milliaction, µaction, and nano-action are more clear to those trained to quickly recognize scale shifts in SI than the equivalent unprefixed langauge. You can do the same thing with currency to make statements like, "I just reached dimillionaire / dimillaire status - I can change my fokus" or "She's a dekamillionaire / dekamillaire — she's reached and launched beyond ever-accelerating eskape velocity".
- dekas (dekamillionaires in American / US currency models — a substantially different species of wealth beyond millaire / millionaire that requires a word label, especially since a deka as of wrighting today at end of 02025 is equivalent to a millaire / millionare from 01966 - the klassikal 01960s word millionaire should be rereferenced deka today). At the deka level almost no one today⁵ with reasonable wants and needs wouldn't accelerate year over year thru kompounding like a plasma engine to "litespeed" and "litening" intergenerational experiences
- hektos (hektomillionaires in American / US currency models). Someone in the class of wealth of hundred+ mill is in the "hekto" wealth category⁵. Hektos with liquidity are unbelievably⁵ flexibly⁵ free if they're medically healthy⁵ and wish to be.


Relationships, Intimacy, and Kalmunity⁵
---------------------------------------

- kore friend or kore [see also: inner, outer, and family⁵ acquaintance](proposal for a term for true classical friend, someone we regularly⁵ spend facetime with and mutually⁵ grow with. You're not kore with people you haven't seen for weeks or months; to be a kore requires a certain amount of intensive kalmunication and a willingness to share personal experiences for kritikal growth, support, study⁵, eudæmonia, and problemsolving — don't dilute, please don't tolerate marketers like Facebook diluting this term kore or kore friend; if you have an app that lists kores those kores should fade to being relabeled automatically as inners, outers, or family¹²³⁴⁵ acquaintances instead if enuf time passes without true established contact. This is really important for socialization, calmunity⁵ caring, and balancing creative solitude with loneliness, especially untended loneliness, prevention; happy to provide facemate.org to any public benefit or nonprofit that's serious about promoting true, regular friendship under seriously⁵ honest Dunbar limit discussion and classifications - no one on the site should be permitted to have more than 150 facemate contacts, ever, including active acquaintances registered, and in general should be warned and resisted if going beyond Dunbar inner layers; any active acquaintance or facemate additions when you're already at 150 have to be paired with a conscious Dunbar limit acquaintance freeze / inactivity tag / drop; making room for a new facemate or active acquaintance must come at an accepted and acceptable tradeoff cost — it's not possible to be actively acquainted, in a meaningful way, with more than 150 people; influencers and calmunity⁵ connectors / leaders who intimate or suggest otherwise are generally lying or misleading to one degree or another if they act to you like they're a Dunbar friend or facemate [])
- µdowry (arguably a much more functional and ancient alternative to thotless diamond ring reliance - any ring selection, if You still need or want one and prioritize it as a fungible free spend, can come from fungible µdowry⁵ gift, exercise in responsible couple's future-oriented resource budgeting and bonding — but you should be free to divert the µdowry to anything, from a more experimencial honeymoon (which pays relationship dividends and reduces divorce rates) to an amazing, storyful artifact for your home like skulptural bookshelves where your souls can grow and continuously⁵ reentwine with the unique furnishments of that unique furniture). The original Blesséd author hopes Pre30 breaks and brakes down lemming diamond ring default culture. It's an indefensible waste typically on a lot of levels, especially as costs rise beyond a few han / hun dollars, and higher spending on rings is empirically⁵ correlated with _higher_ divorce rates, not longer marriages as De Beersr misleads you to believe.  It's actually a mark of bad kareactor, not good kareactor, for your partner to buy you a diamond ring, especially an expensive or natural diamong ring, without a super-deep discussion about whether it's the rite way to spend and all the alternatives and life-kompounding differences of those alternatives. There are approximately ro reasons to purchase a natural diamond anymore; all natural diamond sales should kollapse quickly⁵ from lack of any konsumer demand in any wealth kategory⁵. Not to pick on anyone, but the idea of Jeff Bezos buying Lauren Sanchez Bezos a diamond ring is, I assure you, a form of madness to Bezos _and_ Sanchez. Sanchez would have been better off receiving an additional $5 million and deciding for herself how to best spend those super-unusually large milli-dowry⁵ (mdowry⁵) funds. I suspekt she wouldn't have spent on a $5 mill (million) diamond if the funds were transferred to her and it was her free choice on what to spend that dowry⁵ on, even at that supra-stratospheric interplanetary⁵ skale of coupled "hektobill" (hektobillionaire) wealth.  I should note here when bringing up this marriage that if I had to pick a team, I'd certainly⁵ be on Team Scott, especially given the presumptive needs of the children, and separately Scott's utterly record-breaking remarkable "relentless" philanthropy⁵ and unusually⁵ empowering unrestricted-giving philanthropic model, but I really hope for the best for everyone, even in messy situations, and I don't presently⁵ have my hand forced any further than that on needing to moralize over the nature of better and best rings or things.
- krystallization: The phenomenon where a person who is in love, or was in love or infatuated, can not see faults in the one they admire(d). They can't in that condition see imperfections. This often corresponds with the limerant phase of love. To get yourself or a person into or, in other situations, out of crystallization is a critically⁵ important skill for facemates to perfect. There's a special case of crystallization where one is β-crystallized, a condition in which a person is subservient to the wishes of the person they crystallized. Some American speakers call this the "whipped" state, but in Blessed this is a more admirable β-crystallization and represented in the crystal structure of chocolate. We hope that you find that for yourself reciprocated for the rest of your century⁵. The notion of crystallization was discussed by Stendhal.
- Safewords and ∱agewords (sagewords, fully⁵-integrated age words)
- Take 10
- Bedroom Ref (Utopian)
- Bedroom CPR - Bedroom "Consent Primary Response"
- SRE - sexual⁵ reliability⁵ engineering
- Stubborn sexuality
- stubborn / αpe / Rαpe spectrum
- apology⁵ rites (corrective and preventive)
- ring or thing (resisting thotless diamond ring lemming culture; amethyst hearthstone example alternative)
- friend (duty⁵ to mutual improvement; actively searching for better word post-Facebook 'friend' valence and primary meaning loosening / destruction)
- limerance (exists in American but not well-known)
- n-counter
- Leftover men (and companion leftover women)


Health and Wellness
-------------------

- steep: bodybrain steepening sleep. Just as tea steeps given time to rest, our bodies require a significant amount of steepening overnight. Pulling allnighters in skool is a violation of steep; it corrodes and undermines the very thing that you're seeking to attain, consolidated, steepened conscientious knowledge and wisdom. And failing to steep kills so many persons on the road from fatigued driving. While so many of us routinely do it, it's difficult at population skale to morally justify⁵ driving under a certain number of hours of steep. Sleep deprivation is a very dangerous health and safety⁵ risk. I at least hope for a more Blesséd balance of time commuting or at work versus time spent in hi-quality⁵ steep as automation progresses and a 32 hour workweek becalms more acceptably⁵ approvable and feasible in non-race industries (not in student edukation for instance).
- hiits / devotions: A word for exercise everywhere, anywhere, to gather incidental METs thru our flows in daily⁵ life, anywhere, in coffee shops or restaurants or workplaces before or after finishing our strides. Candidate words for this right now are "hiits" (more nonreligious, high-intensity interval trainings) or "devotions" (preferred, whether I'm acting civigious religious and|or branch religious). Can be paired with metabo policy⁵ or law to raise incidental METs everywhere. This word, if well-chosen, if well-socialized as a practice, could become a lifetime achievement for anyone involved in engraining this, so hi the impact would be. It would be really lifesaving to turn weirdos, positive deviants, who exercise everywhere in public spaces, to be the norm. Other ideas for this word might be "do hiits" or "do its", mapping deliberately⁵ supportively into ubiquitous Nike "Just Do It" marketing, torquing it a bit to "Do Hiit", with me whenever I see a Nike logo or "Just Do It" or "Just Do HIIT" shirt dropping to do some situps or pushups or taking a minute or a moment to do some squats. How beautiful would it be if we could wear a swoosh or a Do Hiit shirt, walk down a few city blocks, and see naybors walking side by side break their stride and stop for a second together, drop together when they catch cite of us to do a base+bonus situps, pushups, or other plyometric exercises with impulsive devotion to health. The Nike (winged victory⁵) swoosh logos and Just Do It™ logos are already circulating worldwide; it would be amazing if we could tether into it with Just Do Hiit devotions. That would be amazing to see. I don't own any Nike gear to my knowledge, as I try to avoid brands, but for this I would _gladly_, _eagerly_ wear Nike gear periodically⁵, tuning to calmunity⁵, or especially⁵ for Gymday (which weekday?) "Just Do Hiit" starter stock habit focus. My facemate suggested the idea of third spaces, workspaces, and calmunity⁵ spaces having small options to n-courage preventative / health hiits and devotions like toe-bars or n-couragement zones, and they'd definitely be awesome and help, but devotions are their own re:ward and whether restaurants and cafés and workspaces make physical room and time for hiit or devotions you can always do them anywhere plyometrically⁵ during breaks in activity⁵. If someone told me to stop or tried discouraging me by saying I was being weird or unprofessional, I'd tell them it's a form of devotion or life prayer, and I'd push back, asking them why their spaces have to be "protected" from religious physical exertion. This should be just a definition that's not overwhelmingly long linked to a wider sociocultural/sociotechnical miracle proposal document. Josh A. and Corey came up with this idea with me on Focusmate and at a Starbucks where I was doing base+bonus devotions before every session. The practice was revived and upregulated tremendously⁵ through a Focusmate naming convention I imitated from another member who labeled their name as "Name (make me do 10+ situps+pushups)" - I adopted this as "David (make me do 10+ situps+pushups) C." which upregulated preventative incidental exercise (devotions / do hiits) so much that it became a core practice worth codifying in langauge.
- Flag sentinel: A "sentinel event" experience where a person who is suffering tremendous despair can report to any registered flag sentinel or mandatory reporter and burn a national flag ritualistically, signifying that they are beyond themselves with desperation over how to solve a critical or emergency problem in their lives. The burning of a flag is a formal sentinel event distress kall. On the burning of a flag, the sentinel suicidality⁵ investigator calmunity⁵ (see Speakers for the Dead below) goes into action to triage, stabilize, and investigate what's happening in that person's biopsychosocial circumstances and does what it can, within reason, to provide a path for the distressed sentinel toward a happy recovery. (Utopian)
- Speakers for the Dead: Whenever a flag sentinel event gets triggered, either thru a early warning flag burning or, in an utter catastrophe, thru the suspekted despaired death of a soul in the kalmunity⁵ (most obviously, any suicide) a Speaker for the Dead should be appointed to serve as a supportive investigator, to share a report on what's going wrong or what went wrong in that person's biopsychosocial environment to cause so much despair, whether it be simple hopeless fatalism, 'altruistic' fatalism, failure of social bonds, social stigma, embarassment, or institutional oppression, lack of a motivating why⁵, or any other kause. The Speakers for the Dead will not always speak in positive eulogies; their principal focus should be to be honest and candid about the social mileau that led to the person's death-wish or death, and they may say things in interpreting the events that embarass, guilt, or otherwise burden those who remain living or those who died, but their goal is to help prevent the next string of flag sentinel ævent from happening thru deeper kalmunity⁵ candor and honesty⁵ about the virtues, vices, individual and dualindiv responsibility⁵  of those who have a death-wish but also those who were reasonably, by lokal kalmunity⁵ standards, jointly or severally⁵ socially responsible, and how these ævents arise and sometimes fester without fast, fair, proportional merit resolution. Speakers for the Dead will sometimes get important details wrong, but they will try their level best to understand everyone's point of view kompassionately and figure out where our invdividualism, dualinidivism, and kalmunity⁵ system failed when failure kases get severe enuf to merit a krash sene investigation and social/institutional system troubleshooting report, as all prodromal flag sentinel events, death-wishes, and attempted or kompleted suisides do. And frankly⁵, a lot of these Speaker for the Dead reports may best be CCed back to the affected parties' elementary⁵, middle skool, and hi skool koalition systems to help ankor prevention in édukation and ædukation as early⁵ as reasonably possible, to reduce the unreported and reported flag sentinel rate as much as we reasonably⁵ kan. Certainly⁵ inspired by Orson Scott Card's book, Speaker for the Dead (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7967.Speaker_for_the_Dead), and the initial author's own painful experimences not being heard, handled, or allowed to translate insite into systemik peer prevention with a Speaker for the Dead who would take those of us seriously on our logik and ilogik rather than throwing everything into the "illness" and "mysterious biochemikal-imbalance irrationality" buket without studying the balance of institutional, social, and religious forces that periodikally⁵ pin so many of us into hopeless purposefulness situations. (Utopian)
- good / tasty dikotomy⁵ (try to be very strict with this usage, be critical of abuse and slippage)
- sugar overload
- Heartclot / Healthclot
- Corpser / corpsing (death behaviors, like harmful nicotine addictions)
- Quit grit
- Steep (steep [sleep] steepens minds)
- despair dysregulation ('desperate for air', over 'depression')
- hope dysregulation (over 'mania')
- klassification (over 'diagnosis' in psychiatry⁵)
- Ribbreaker (clearer, more direct than sternum-cartilege-breaker)


Civigion, Government, and Society
---------------------------------

- Hæring: An event in which you and all counterparts and any witnesses are heard, by uninvolved neutral parties, and have a chance to hear from them as well. Your voice and understanding interacts with your counterparts in lock-and-key fashion, supportively decrypting with one another your fractional best-effort recollections of the events. You are all required to be present, and you are all required to speak, hear, and dynamically interact with questioning and honest and complete responses, subject to any recognized right not to self-incriminate. Your fundamentally partly unreliable narrative memory is tested separately and in koupled states, to understand what the past looked like to the best of our ability⁵ when there is a separation between you and when you fase each other and truly⁵ "hær" each other, in couples "ashes to ashes (æ - aesc)" "Adam with Eve, Eve with Adam" form. "Hearings" in which only one person or a subset of persons who must be there appear or where some parties are unquestionable, noninteractive, never reasonably memory-coupled for interactive mutual memory examination and mutual realtime privacy unlock (for instance, in romantic harassment or sexual harassment cases, mutual fair realtime prespousal, spousal, or postspousal privacy right layer decryption), or unchallengeable do not qualify as Hærings. The author has been through such a fraudulent "Hearing" where the Innocenter was never heard, let alone compassionately questioned or challenged interactively, that wasn't a Hæring — failing to assemble a fair Hæring where everyone directly involved must appear and interact whenever feasible and possible when one is necessary can be dramatically worse than having no Hearing or process at all and be a wrecking ball to peoples' lives, leading to extended "undecidable lack of purpose or clarity" suicidal reasoning for lack of closure, and the absence of a Hæring can or should in itself be an obvious legal cause of action for tremendous punitive damages when pivotal decisions are made in institutions where and when Hærings are required under the law.
- Calment line: The age at which one has reached or surpassed the age of Jeanne Calment, the most elderly human in modern times verified by modern records, and likely the oldest person to have lived in the last 1,000 years, at least. Crossing this line comes with a proposed loss of voting rights and carries steep risks to worldwide intergenerational færtility⁵, especially as the United Nations continues to greatly underestimate the population explosion that biotechnologists are predicting with endless aggregating explosions in effective healthy modifiable lifespan in the next 50 to 100 to 250 years (see, for example, the work and dedication of the Methusaleh Foundation) without a groundwork of Calment line reasoning. Part of the notion of Blesséd is that there is a point at which we can rest from Borlauging; that there comes a point with lifespan where enough is enuf. The Calment line is what is proposed for what is enuf. There is an enormous amount of Borlauging need between here and there but the duty to overclock for human life is not uncapped or without limit. (Semi-Utopian)
- Færtility⁵: The notion that fertility should be thoughtful and fair for everyone, whatever their sex, gender, orientation, national origin, ethical race, or position in the generations. In the common context of "be fruitful and multiply", this means multiplying fractionally for growth over hundreds and thousands, tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of future years on Earth, not floating point and not using the integers alone, but always growing, even if slowly, as People and Peoples for as long as we can. There are some implications to færtility⁵; every couple deserves the chance, if they're playing the part of birth parents, to have a chance to see if a girl or a boy is born. Always two rolls of the dice, at least, for every couple — anything ever any less is inhumane, as parents commonly envision themselves in the sex or genders of their children; it's not common for a young parent to image except by prompted ethics reasoning an opposite sex/gender birth natively as part of their predominent imagination, and we need to make sure we recognize that and provide at least two dice rolls always. Blesséd argues that conception færly begins before fertilization, when names are picked, either by foresight and responsible discussion and calmprehensive action (with choice of reproductive or contraceptive paths) or by default mode to "Lucky", "Chance" or an equivalent for an unplanned, "unintended" or breakthrough lucky or chance birth. Nations and Peoples all have a right (and a responsibility⁵) to grow, but that's not measured in square meters conquered; it's measured best in living souls birthed, berthed, or immigrated. Explosions in lifespan could or would impair the ability of the sevth generation to reproduce freely and with færtility⁵ themselves, for that see the Calment line. In countries or peoples that have fertility levels below national færtility⁵, there should not be any ethics questioning about couples who have an explosive number of births, taking as given that they have the capacity to ethically care and provide for them without great hardship or child deprivation.  In countries that are in resource-constrained pockets in the world where birth rates are explosive, particularly where there's a demographic democratic bomb threat, deeper questions need to be asked about what fractional multiplicative færtility⁵ in that lokal region truly is or should be. There are countries today that face existential threats internally³ and from naybors who run births relentlessly in a birth arms race, seeking to win wars and territory through womb occupancy rates and historical religious claims of land ownership they imagine their births will one day repopulate, even and typically especially when it isn't even matched by deeply reciprocal harmless human éducational achievement across those "pregnancy war" very "unfærtile" borders, and an equal respect for the incompatibility and irrelevance of historical religious claims of land ownership under the border-freezing "possession is 9/10ths of law" principle the Journals of Assassination are likely to help enforce someday⁵ in Westphalian super-peaceful territory freezes except for highly Hippocratic consensual swaps, marriage unions, and divorce divisions. (Semi-Utopian)
- Highering humans: Model of hiring where we try what we heighten and higher humans everywhere humans ought to be, like education, craftswomanship, creativity⁵, all layers of service from food service to housing placement, crisis care, and other fields that require a human touch, and we colaborate across entity definitions on placing candidates where they're better suited with reasonable and responsible speed, even and especially if that means giving people a list of calmpetitors

Religion and Philosophy
-----------------------

- "Good, better, best": A childhood rhyme. The traditional version can be improved: instead of the original, teach instead "Good, better, best: Never let them rest. Until the better get [better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213233.Better) and the good get best." In Blesséd, we want others and our core, inners, outers, and family⁵ to launch past our achievement, performance, and happiness levels calmpetitively⁵. Rising tides raise all boats; let's make the better better and the good best. It's a natural motto for humans.

Life Planning and Economics
---------------------------

- reverse synth: the process of reverse synthesizing a life or anything else you face or are konsidering creating or synthesizing. Originally⁵ from the planning process of reverse synthesis in the "theory of change", kemistry⁵ (chemistry⁵), where you work backwards from where you want to go, your target, back to your source or present state, and not just forwards to logic your way toward creating whatever you want to create. Sometimes its easier to see the step just before you get married; if that involves a prenup, and if that prenup needs to be decided early enuf for your choice of partner to change, why not reposition to prenup in reverse synthesis to pre-proposal, in anticipation of a ring or thing? Reverse synth is extremely highly encouraged and urged for any major life action or decision, especially major gates like reaching career training, job placement, engagement, and marriage. We want to see more reverse synth in planning and linear life optimization. The proposed Pre30 site is driven by the impulse to help assist with smoothing all the important pitfalls and difficulties of reverse syth "working backward" backward engagement and dating planning logic.
- berth and berthday
- X+N berth planning
- frupidity (borrowed and copied from the lexicon of Amazon); frugality⁵ is a kore klassikal virtue, frupidity is its inverse where rekless frugality⁵ kauses unnecessary⁵ pennywise, pound-foolish suffering. Not offering national freely available convenient Basic Life Support training to everyone everywhere in the developed world is an example of fiscal frupidity that's killing millions of people.
- one-way door (also borrowed from the lexicon of Amazon):
- designer (Buckminster Fuller definition: A designer is an emerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist and evolutionary strategist.)


Language and Expression
-----------------------

- architexture (most of all in the context of choice architexture, where textual reference sources drive calmplex decision-making. Exercise your freadom whenever and wherever you can; fight and defy⁵ those who restrict your freadom)
- Freadom: The freedom to read whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want, limited only by the need to support or re:ward the creative author and the print, production, and distribution process that delivers the reading to your hands. This is a very, very fundamental freedom, perhaps the most fundamental freedom.
- Re:ward - A more calmpleat representation of the American or King's English notion of reward. A re:ward may be a primary or secondary operant conditioner like the primary reinforces like food, steep, or even ecstatic sexual intimacy⁵, but it might also be fungible monies and budgets as a secondary operant conditioner, or interpersonal re:guard, civigious or religiously principled virtue and conscience discharge as its own re:ward, or a change in the "ward" you're scoped to be privileged to serve within. For many of us, the greatest possible re:ward is being able to serve more in either a similar or different service ward, whether that's within our family⁵ or across families, within the tite boundaries of our town, where we might be able to make the most impakt, or across those borders and boundaries, if teknology⁵ trees help re:ward us like so.
- Ackselerate / ackceptance: Emphasizes the "ack" in acknowledgement steps in protocols in information science. The colaborative process of speeding up action _tremendously⁵_ by engaging in two-way, clear proposition, acceptance, and verification of proposed or necessary⁵ action. It operates on a "trust but verify⁵" model, where coupled responsible actors — whether natural like life partners or grouped organizations — accept a goal, agree roughly on how that goal will be reached, pitches in to get it done, and then, after it's done or seems done, everyone checks the quality⁵ of what happened: ackseleration doesn't happen without calm, conscientious quality⁵ assurance together as part of the final "ack" step, acknowledging work well-done.

Additional Stubs needing more basic klarifikation
-------------------------------------------------

- Race (default: refuse to interpret this as skin- or ancestry-based, instead discern physical or industrial or electoral race; your race being your next 5K or sport calmpetition, your most urgent pursuit in family⁵ or interfamily⁵ at or around work, or the civigious or political calmunity⁵ race that you're most likely to race to help full-court press). For a long time, I wrote and represented my race as Congressional Race Ohio 18 (OH-18), a diminished virtual imaged and imaginary⁵ at-large district after Ohio's population fell to 17 House seats. Let's not acknowledge in Blesséd other forms of race. If you want to ask about skin-tone, kin ancestry or klan, that's another thing, that's not race, that's skin-deep or genetic origin questioning, not a reflection or acceptable stereotype or summary of Your kareactor. And if you want to be skin-deep, please try to use the IC codes Great Britain uses or another friction layer imposed between sight and stereotype to eliminate or slow stereotype and stereotype threat and measurable implicit biases.
- Thoughtfulness ranges: what calmunity⁴⁵ / kalmunity⁴⁵ means vs say kalmunity²³⁴. There are a lot of situations in life where you don't want to be philosophizing for too long due to short-akting needs, where earlier authority²³⁴ may be needed. Final justifications¹ kan even be final and nonarguable at one why or aspekt. It depends on the situation and prinsiple that's at stake.


Needs Development
-----------------

- Newsletter and alerts for valuable languistic harm reductions that get proposed and adopted; it's not functional to expect people to keep polling to check the dictionary⁵; it should push out to them if they subscribe to languistic change
- Develop a "See also" if it doesn't exist yet. I think there's a "reference" model in place, check if that meets needs and is included in word and phrase entry scripts.


Progress Notes
--------------

✅ **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Dual definition system implemented!
The dictionary schema now supports both American Standard and Blesséd Dialekt definitions side-by-side (Rosetta Stone approach), plus usage examples and harm reduction notes. See:
- [SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md](../SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md)
- [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md](../EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md)

Note: Original concern about self-referentiality has been addressed through the dual-definition system. Each entry can now provide clarity in both American Standard (for bootstrapping) and Blesséd Dialekt (for integrated usage).

✅ KB (knowledge base ⇌ keyboard schema lock) - **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Keyboard Layout (KB) system implemented with versioning, known issues tracking, and integration with Knowledge Base. See [DICTIONARY_SYSTEM.md - Keyboard Layouts section](../DICTIONARY_SYSTEM.md#keyboard-layouts-kb-system)

✅ Long Now Years: 02025 instead of 2025 - **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Implemented as standard date format throughout the system. See [PROMPT.md - Date Format Convention](../PROMPT.md)

✅ Unambiguous dates (YYYYY-MM月DD format) - **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Adopted as standard format with 月 character for unambiguous month designation. Big-endian ordering for sortability. See [PROMPT.md](../PROMPT.md)
