Needs Development
-----------------
- Newsletter and alerts for valuable languistic harm reductions that get proposed and adopted; it's not functional to expect people to keep polling to check the dictionary⁵; it should push out to them if they subscribe to languistic change
- Develop a "See also" if it doesn't exist yet. I think there's a "reference" model in place, check if that meets needs and is included in word and phrase entry scripts.

##### renovator (over innovator)
- The emphasis on "innovation" as some type of "out of nowhere, non-calmunity⁵ / non-strukturally⁵-integrated" funktion is a wildly poor model of what kind of inkremental and disruptive innovation aktually happens and how. Almost all aktivity⁵ kalled "innovation" is best done, and almost always needs to be done, within an existing strukture or kalmunity⁵. That's renovation, not isolated innovation. Gaining aksess to struktures where you kan renovate is one of the hardest challenges fasing renovators who kome from outside. Being understood as a renovator rather than an innovator is important to finding akseptanse in kalmunities with strong needs for wise, prudent, kareful konservation of resources and existing struktures when fased with renovation hypotheses that require kreative destruktions, espesially⁵ when there's a period of demolition for the renovation, like when a sporting goods store konsiders karefully⁵ whether and how to renovate toward exklusively supporting brain-developing youth sports and not any brain-damaging youth sports for anyone younger than, I'd argue, a Representative (25 years old). In this initial author's experimence, so much of my time was lost trying to navigate "innovator vs renovator" diskussion and dining philosopher blokades. It's easy to mistake a renovator for a kaotik, isolated innovator, and it's easy to lose sight of how important it is to site yourself in a kalmunity⁵ and strukture if you fall into identify⁵ing as an innovator instead of as a renovator. I've made that mistake also. A lot. Being able to innovate really well seems to require some deep integration into but also some kritikal distanse from existing konserved standards, but it shouldn't be so long that you're an outsider rather than inside as a full-on renovator. Relabeling innovators, innovation awards, etc. as renovators and renovation awards and kalmpetitions would really help, this author thinks, in shifting the lokus of intellektual labor back to where it belongs, kloser to and within or adjoining the struktures where change needs to happen, with launch sequenses and adaptance models that involve ankoring into deeply real existing systems rather than theoretikal, idealized kustomers and kustomizers.

##### First Responder
- In Blesséd Dialekt, you're not a first responder unless you arrive to handle emergencies in 90 seconds or less. Anything after 90 seconds is a second responder. Naybors are natural first responders; naybors can be near you nearly everywhere you ever are at all times. Second responders bring pro-level skills to time-sensitive emergencies as soon as they can but they can't get there fast enuf for a large range of fulminating, explosively time-sensitive problems: everything from the classic cardiac arrest to elderly falls to corpsers smoking a cigarette. See Naybor SOS (https://www.nayborsos.org). We're not demoting American Standard first responders to Blesséd Dialekt second responders. We're pinning response times to 90 seconds or less. If an EMT, fire, or police officer can arrive in under 90 seconds consistently, or from time to time, each time they do they'll achieve true first responder status too on that call. But generally speaking, the most highly trained emergency pros will arrive as second responders after 90 seconds pass, unless our specialization labor economics radically⁵ change, or unless we see a massive explosion in the number of trained EMTs, firefighters, and police academy⁵ trainees in the worlds we pass thru. Someday we might live in a world where everyone spends a civil service year training, among other things, to some minimal level of calmpetency in civil rights officer (police) work and emergency medical support. That's feasible if we will it and Bill it, if we debate it and agree to it in super-large social contract. Maybe then our first responder naybor will almost always be both a former civil rights officer academy⁵ trainee and a Basic Former EMT. It's curious wondering what life would be like in such a world. It would be civigious in ways that would be very important to observe and study⁵. No country⁵ has ever attempted that to my knowledge directly, but many are going thru or have gone thru the lethal military⁵ training route.

##### Moral Monopoly / Moral Monopolist
- If you win a patent in a critical area of research and development, and that patent carries enormous potential for preserving life or essential liberties such that other institutions absolutely are compelled to work with you for all practical purposes or need to appeal to government bodies to exercise their inherent eminent domain wrightes, that status of critical chain "patent royalty" property powers makes you a potential moral monopolist. Pharmaceutical companies with groundbreaking drug patents, for instance, are moral monopolists. Pharmaceutical companies tend to exercise their monopolies not for pure or mostly pure moral goals, but instead to extract maximal profit from populations that can't afford it for no defensible reason. An example is the EpiPen patent monopoly acquired by Mylan, where prices went from $100 to $600 . Another One of the most extreme examples of this is the directed behavior of Martin Shkreli, who raised the price of Daraprim by 5000%. That the government doesn't get closely involved to break and prevent these drug monopolies that are not moral monopolies, but antimoral, thru periodic exercises of eminent domain shocks me. The initial author is looking to set an example of a different kind of patent monopoly exercise, a moral monopoly⁵, adding a chain of conditions to a patent licensure to ensure strong efforts toward better care and justice in institutional settings and making an effort to minimize economic impact on affected populations without sacrificing mission. In this (attempted) patent moral monopoly⁵, the notion is to maximize pressure on moral achievements and barely express economic demand except for what's necessary in securing the future of Lifesaver Labs. Every patent monopolist should credibly fear and be aware of eminent domain risk instead of overweening on economic claim power in coercive pricing decisions. If you are selling an entertainment tool or a better mouse trap you can probably charge whatever you want. But if you are patenting a lifesaving drug or other lifesaving technology⁵, like the lifesaving drugs mentioned before or a technique to genocidally wipe out the malaria-bearing mosquito species to extinction, you should be aware that there are limits to what health economists will find justifiable within bounded rationalities in calm, consensual, non coercive, capitalism. There is a price ceiling and scope ceiling on economic and moral monopolization, and it's found in eminent domaian and Trolley Problem harm. Only the latter seems to be a serious pressure up to now but they should both be wielded to keep moral and economic monopolies in check. The laws can also be used to reinforce a well-organized and well-dedicated moral monopoly⁵. It depends on moral patent monopolist and economic patent monopolist ethics behavior. There are a surprisingly small number of moral monopolists in the annals of history⁵ and herstory⁵. It would be interesting if someone could find an independent patent like the fundamental CRISPR patent accesses for instance that would chokehold pharmaceutical companies within a reasonable range of windfall profit or directed windfalls more into R&D and less into executive compensation and shareholder gains when those same shareholders are part of Family⁵ suffering for lack of access to these drugs. That would be a third mechanism to constrain overweening economic monopolies or any risk of extremist moral monopolists, especially those who don't go diverse or triverse where reasonably necessary. Safeword patent licensing is an example of that. Safeword can push for multilayer evolving contraception extremely hard, but at a certain point when the public doesn't accept further contraceptive layering Safeword will need to get real, accept limits, arguably go diverse on goals, and work within a range that youth and families find calmfortable. That may include, for instance, a world within the next 19 years where almost all young males get treated with reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance for better Fine Nines Færtility⁵ lifelong nonhormonally, with almost no unwanted pregnancy risk and no other contraceptives needed aside from condoms, and even condoms droppable with STD/STI testing. There would naturally need to be fully-informed religious exceptions. The general form of that is where all premarital men and women might bear a moral religious andor legal duty of sharing accurately what their færtility⁵ plan is and what measures they've taken or are taking before sexual intimacy that could be reproductive. But building a foundation for that world may collapse somewhere along the path if Safeword is not careful with moral monopoly⁵ exercise and public persuasion as the technology⁵ evolves and reaches market broadly. Every moral monopoly⁵ needs to be careful about what it asks for and how hard it pushes beyond evidenced or inferrable existing public and stakeholder support given the risk of patent puncture with design workarounds or eminent domain. It's an extremely interesting mechanism for renovators to help nudge the world further.  

Progress Notes
