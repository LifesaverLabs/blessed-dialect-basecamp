Additional Blesséd words / phrases
-----------------------------------
##### safeword library⁵
- key safeword library⁵: grue, graylight, man:go, stop stop / no no and Zelda's triforce no (stop stop stop / no no no)[Nintendo we love you, please support, please don't sue; reach us please, we're happy to talk kulture and change], red light, skramble (get out now, skrambled sekret enforcement)
##### finankal konsequences
- Suggestion æmergent from Claude session on nikotine adiktion: "finankal" konsequences. Bridges the notion of "finanse" and "kalendar" or "kalorie". Maybe there's another dekomposition too in finan-k-al, like finan-kalm-all. Must think of this more; it would be really valuable to story⁵ and spacetime periodikally⁵ finankal planning. Like the lesson that "financial" planning has no meaning if it's not kalendared and kalming to all involved. I'm struggling to find and story⁵ the other "kal" (kalorie) konnektion I kould imagine teachers making but that's perhaps for lack of kreative imagination.
##### mortal library⁵
- mortal library⁵: see mortallibrary.org when launched. Drug resisdænce.
##### resisdænce
- resisdænce: A choreographed resistance that any part of a kouple kan engage in, or that the pair together as a dualindiv kan perform and enjoy⁵. Reformats resistance as a social dance, which is more konsistent with our natures.
##### Marathon / Marathoner / M. (Lastname)
- (Marathon / Marathoner / M.) Lastname: A gender-neutral honorific appelation for a person in a professional or personal context that doesn't require knowledge about that person's marital status like "Ms." and "Mrs." require.  "M" attaches to the notion of "Marathon" or "Moral Marathoner", the notion that each of us has our own lifelong extended moral marathon that we're running in our lives. When a female or male officer of a law enforcement agency writes me, I need to be able to reply back without presuming their marital status, and in a way that respects and honors them for their marathoning nature and work. Same in corporations and all walks of calmunity⁵ life. As an example, the author does not want to be called "Mr. Clayman"; he strongly prefers "Marathon Clayman". My future spouse would have a similar designation, but perhaps a different or joint last name, or I might join her on her family name; it depends on how we decide that question. On that question, I'm in favor of flipping a five-optioned pseudorandom generator; using the very most common last name in USAT as an example for spousal naming: Smith, Clayman, Smith-Clayman, Clayman-Smith, or Smithman. Clayith doesn't make sense. And all these last name options would probably flip over to Klayman to meet Blesséd spelling standards. Whatever the last name, the ideal title I'd say would be Marathon or Marathoner.
##### Wonderbar
- Wonderbar: An expression saying that you've hit a wonderous, amazing level, even if it's the standard bar. So, for instance, if you set a goal of a base of 10 pushups in Just Do Hiit, and you hit your 10 pushups, even if you don't do extra bonus beyond that's "wonderbar" bekause you hit your "entry bar" goal. Even more so if you surpass it and hit a new level you've never hit before. Inspired from Deutsche "wunderbar". Etymology: "wonder" + "bar", where bar has the meaning of a threshold standard. If you have a habit of jogging or running in three 5 minute sprints + bonus, even if you don't run any extra bonus if you hit all three 5-minute sprints that's wonderbar, and the rest is bonus. And if you go back and run three 6-minute sprints the next time, and make that your new standard, when adopted as your standard that then becomes your new wonderbar level and you can push forward for bonus beyond. From this author's point-of-view, in school, a flat A is the wonderbar. Anything less isn't wonderbar. A+ is bonus excellence, tho some tiger grandparents and parents push harder for A+ to be the wonderbar standard. A- might be said to be the bar. Anything below an A- is below the bar and probabilistikally⁵ leads to worse eventual klass levels, tho not always — sometimes grandstudents beat the odds and show ekseptional merit in other ways in their lives. Grades kan only be fraktionally differentiated; they're not final final.
##### Grandstudent
- grandstudent: A student who is trying to klimb the generations and bekome more sage, klimbing beyond their kronologikal age, with the help of their whole family⁵ and Family⁵ tree — saging students reach "grandstudent" status. Similar in some ways and inspired by "grandmaster" in chess, and the kounterpart to grandparent; grandstudents look ahead to being parents and grandparents themselves and work to reverse synthesize in stable stages their lives, aksepting the unsertainty of stages beyond strongly achieved intermediates and being ready to branch or fork in other direktions if their synth and|or reverse synth changes. There good, better, best should be a grandparent-grandstudent-teacher assosiation (GGSTA or similar), where grandparents, parents, students, and grandstudents would feel welkome and have a chanse to koördinate. There are many grandparents who would love to be an aktive part of their grandstudents' edukations and right now they're exkluded from konversation and partisipation in skooling.
##### Wrighte
- wrighte: to wright, rite, right, and write. Among the most fundamental akts.
##### Prespousals
- prespousals: Any person whom you kourt. Some prespousals may bekome a bedmate, if your religious tree, family⁵ or personal traditions and praktises allow. Whether you grow intimate and private beyond a bedroom door as prespousals or not, the stage of prespousal privasy⁵ ought to be rekognized in law in a manner similar to spousal privasy⁵, at least for those who kourt seriously⁵ and are evaluating each other not just for hookups but for bonded marriage and dualindiv spousehood someday. To formally⁵ unlok prespousal privasy⁵, you should be either present with each other or guaranteed a chance to eventually⁵ break out of any prisoner's dilemma kooperatively thru fær prosess. There's an etiquette to prespousal privasy⁵... there's so much you learn about another person in an inkreasingly¹²³⁴⁵ intimate relationship that you shouldn't be interrogated on or release by or to outsiders unless an overwhelming, overriding need arises. Achieving prespousal privasy⁵ wrightes will require sosial and legal change. Perhaps prespousal privasy⁵ might motivate youth movement away from rekreational hookup kaoses and toward something kloser to more long-term-oriented and invested relational or traditional kourtship kulture synthesizing and reverse synthesizing toward a kornerstone or early kapstone Pre30 marriage.
##### Sekond Base Stop
- sekond base stop: For systems that are built to prevent high-voltage sexual violences, that last possible moment when a newly sexually aktive kouple stops at sekond base and gets an SRE seatbelt in plase. You kan go with any software or hardware option or a mix, but please get a SRE seatbelt buckled before you go past the sekond base stop with someone new. At some risk of being overly preskriptive and a languistik antitrust violation, it's better of kourse to "Open Safeword, Open Sesame". (work in progress - unsure and unkalmfortable with embedding a brand name into the diktionary⁵; it's a useful illustration of a better, earlier aktivation step before sekond base stop but has balanced produkt/service/system diversity⁵ support and genericization implikations init author need to think thru and reflekt further on)
##### Katchy⁵ / Catchy⁵
- katchy⁵ / catchy⁵: An utterance, mixed media, teknology⁵, or other aktivity⁵ or artifakt that catches the thoughtful and makes them more thoughtful. As an example, if you create a preventative teknology⁵ in the field of sexual assault prevention built on langauge that's truly catchy⁵, it should attract the thoughtful, promote, achieve, and anchor much more considerate thoughtfulness, and also, in this context, catch XYs who are "y⁵", consistently practicing the Five Whys. I'm hoping to see many, many more catchy⁵ vidéos, software experimences, and other ært and ærtful technologies as we continue to find better and better ways to grow and flourish.
##### Patron and Patron Reversal
- patron and patron reversal: Lawyers don't have clients. They have patrons. I don't know when lawyers and Members of the Bar started reversing the notion of klient and patron, but it confuses and is confusing in the experience of paid speech. In social and public choice, if a company officer or elected officer receives more than X dollars or CALM or currency of whatever denomination from a person or institution, to the point where it's a major salient factor in their ongoing decision-making, that's a pivotal patron relationship, not a client or ordinary customer relationship. It depends somewhat on the business's reliance and "re:venue" structure of course... if you're purchase is a vanishingly small portion of their re:venue you might be a customer and not a patron. Lawyers can't claim the people they represent are anything other than patrons. Patrons are misdescribed as clients all the time. In the field of public representation, the (initial) author would describe any representative who takes enuf from someone where it affects their time distributions and priorities is a patron, not a donor. Anyone who takes, say, a $250+ contribution from the tobacco or nicotine industry and its executives has the tobacco and nikotine industry as their patron. We should force our representatives more heavy-handedly to have clean patronage lists we can agree with if they accept patrons. Please resist if politicians call donors above your acceptance threshold call them donors: they're patrons. Elon Musk is a notable patron in USAT on the "right". Alex and George Soros are notable patrons on the "left". Traditionally all patrons aim or hope to Tongtie (https://www.tongtie.us). The commercial moral version of this is seen at a store like an Athletics Supply Store. The National Football League is a patron of almost all sports stores and has tongtied almost all of them and their employees, who very often know much better, thru their patronage on what employees and owners of sports supply stores can say without provoking counterreaction. This also happened with gun stores and integrated electronic fingerprint readers around the time of the New Jersey Personalized Handgun law (https://www.thetrace.org/2023/05/new-jersey-childproof-smart-handgun-law/), which is an outrageous example of Tongtied patronage networks under the konrolling influens of the National Rifle Assosiation kontrolling the pase of advansed safety teknology⁵ in personalized handgun progress. Why should the NRA as patron be standing in the way of fingerprint and face ID on pistols and handguns? Do they really represent progress in rifle and handgun safety⁵ teknology⁵ or do they just believe in brute politikal power thru intimidation and harassment of gun store owners, to the point where BioFire was "gunshy" about registering their produkt for inklusion in all New Jersey's gun stores as most all "rational" kommersial aktors would? Given the structure of the market, gun buyers might be customers, but the NRA has a kontrolling koordinating position as a pivotal patron.
##### LGBTQS / SLGBTQ
- LGBTQS / SLGBTQ: What a major mistake it was, I'd argue, for LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bigender, Transsexual, Questioning) to be wholly separated and isolated from S (Straight), on an acronym that's supposed to be designed to be maximally⁵ inclusive of all sexual orientations. Why⁶ can't we be all on the SLGBTQ spectrum? Or LGBTQS? I'd be happy with either as long as the meaning was picked up that, hopefully, in Blesséd people who are S don't feel above, different, and ideologically⁵ completely separated from LGBTQ but rather also somewhere on the Kinsey spectra of born and accepted sexual orientation. Just try please if we use LGBTQS this isn't "LGBTQs". It's "LGBTQS", where the "S" is pronounced as a coequal part as "es" ("LGBTQS") not a plural on LGBTQ (which would have been more like "LGBTQzah"). Very sadly, I never learned or rigorously learned IPA. I'd really like IPA to be a basic topic in school systems in United States before learning any furhter in a high school foreign langauge class, but that's definitely 10th Amendment State choice material. I hope no States break away and all States kalmpakt on International Phonetic Alphabet teachings and trainings. High schools wouldn't produse idiotes like me who can't think thru the fundamentals of langauge and speech karefully⁵.
##### (Adult) Fokohol
- Adult: fokohol. "faux" alkohol, but also with the meaning of "f.o." alkohol. The health konsensus supports dissuasions or campaigns against even minimal dose ethanol poisonings (alcohol imbibition) in social settings, particularly without BAK (Blood Alkohol Konsentration) Readers present and readily⁵ available mocktail, "fokohol", and other harmless alternatives. There's a really rich library⁵ of mocktails and so many other drinks that are delisious and supportive of seremonial and situasional konviviality⁵ and sosiality⁵. To the extent that you may be looking for disinhibision, I don't know how to fully⁵ replikate the eksaggerating, impulsiv effekts of deeper ethanol poisoning without kompromising konsent quality⁵ when dating, so which do you want? Feminist Yes! or lightheadedness and diskordination with vomiting and possible ℝαpe kit testing the next day? Rejekting men bekause they say they (a) don't want to drink ethanol or even indikate (b) they won't pay for any ethanol poisoning for you is so romantikally⁵ irresponsible on hexy⁵ grounds I don't even know where to start. The opposite should be the kase; you should gravitate to kourting males who, on hearing you litmus-test on alkohol poisoning resistænce hexiness, if you risk litmus-testing on alkohol resistænce, resist and don't pay for any ethanol for you and redirekt you to fokohol, mocktails, or other harmless alternatives like stevia soda pop at least until you're deep into a sertified, well-established, well-patterned bedroom bond, if ever. If you do litmus test, and they buy you a drink, take one sip, bide your time to the extent you wish, and don't talk to them or limit kontakt again after that date. Please send them a brakeoff or breakup feedbak so they get the message loud and klear. "I think your offer to buy me ethanol poisoning supports ______ (there's a whole library⁵ of ad-libs I'd plase here) [historikal/kurrent] kulture, and I kan't tolerate that. (insert personal experimence or the story⁵ of a standard)". It should be much, much more sosially⁵ risky on a date to offer to buy ethanol poisoning than it is to refuse to pay for any ethanol poisonings on your date even if s/he asks or even begs and pleads for it. Today, given what we know, given our very⁵ healthy⁵ and klean water systems, even in religious kontexts, the idea of feeding grandchildren alkohol is extraordinarily⁵ questionable, and depending on your religious feelings indefensible, at least in Hh. The health konsensus says HhÅÆIers and HhÅÆCers from the Latter Day Saints tradision and similar on ethanol poisonings and alkohol were very right all along.

Blesséd Number System
---------------------
- "d" or "t" (ty) [my pronunciation varies] in place of "ten" and tens place ("four-d-one" [fourdyone] / "four-t-one" [fourtyone])
- No irregularities between ones place numbers and tens place or any other leading numbers — not "fifty", fivedy or fivety; also not "thirty", threedy or threety instead.
- No irregularities in the elevens and teens (dyone/tyone = 11, dytwo/tytwo, dythree/tythree, etc. etc. up to dynine/tynine)
- Very open to other suggestions about how to wright these number words. I'd be very happy to write fourdyone as fourTone or fourDone, with the T or D denoting and separating the tens place helpfully⁵ visually⁵.
- Standard International prefixes for any unit modify and adjust that unit up or down in scale, sometimes across really tremendous scales beyond typical langauge.



Relationships, Intimacy, and Kalmunity⁵

##### Quit grit

-----------------------------------------------
##### Rase, aka Ethics Rase
- Race (default: refuse to interpret this as skin- or ancestry-based, instead discern physical or industrial or electoral race; your race being your next 5K or sport calmpetition, your most urgent pursuit in family⁵ or interfamily⁵ at or around work, or the civigious or political calmunity⁵ race that you're most likely to race to help full-court press). For a long time, I wrote and represented my race as Congressional Race Ohio 18 (OH-18), a diminished virtual imaged and imaginary⁵ at-large district after Ohio's population fell to 17 House seats. Let's not acknowledge in Blesséd other forms of race. If you want to ask about skin-tone, kin ancestry or klan, that's another thing, that's not race, that's skin-deep or genetic origin questioning, not a reflection or acceptable stereotype or summary of Your kareactor. And if you want to be skin-deep, please try to use the IC codes Great Britain uses or another friction layer imposed between sight and stereotype to eliminate or slow stereotype and stereotype threat and measurable implicit biases.
##### Thoughtfulness ranges
- Thoughtfulness ranges: what calmunity⁴⁵ / kalmunity⁴⁵ means vs say kalmunity²³⁴. There are a lot of situations in life where you don't want to be philosophizing for too long due to short-akting needs, where earlier authority²³⁴ may be needed. Final justifications¹ kan even be final and nonarguable at one why or aspekt. It depends on the situation and prinsiple that's at stake.
##### Wheren
- Wheren: Where and when, with "whenabouts / whereabouts" expressive default kareakter. "Wheren do you want to meet? Have a spacetime in mind?" Another expressive alternative to trigger and diskuss spacetime planning.
##### "Better Life, Better Death" Hunting, Herding, and Fishing
- "better death" and "better life" hunting: When the lethal method of hunting or fishing is more painless and quik and better dedikated (as much flesh as possible used) than the likely death distribution the organism would face in the wild. It's going to be to some extent species and region-spesifik. While it may akselerate death, it is a more humane (painless, quik, respektful, useful) stokastik end to the organism's life. It's the kind of death a Native American would wish on those organisms they hunt. An example of an ethiks gap this opens klearly⁵ would be between wild fishing and farm fishing. In wild fishing, the death is akselerated but the fish would have to die eventually in nature one way or another, whereas in wild fishing the life and death is manufaktured and the death was always unnesessary⁵; there is no natural death distribution to fairly match the organism to bekause its life kourse wouldn't have even begun without the artifisial mekanisms and kontrols of farmed fishing; the life of the fish doesn't fit into the natural karrying kapasity⁵ of the oseans, seas, lakes, or rivers. You kan not use a likely death distribution from nature and apply it to a farmed animal klaiming "better death" humane treatment — that's analogikally⁵ like giving birth to a fetal baby in an antiseptik, highly konditioned, unnatural laboratory⁵ only for the purposes of killing it in a unnatural lab. This wrighter does not typikally distinguish or much kare about the difference between "artifisial" and "natural" kemikals, but when it komes to life there's a much greater duty⁵ to distinguish between artifisially engineered life starts with the purpose of flesh-harvest and hunting and fishing to akselerate with better death natural populations. This has reasonability⁵ limits. The wrighter has no issues with land management and resource management polisies by Fish and Wildlife Departments to assist along natural population growth in nature to raise, for instance, deer populations by kulling wolves. That doesn't in this wrighter's view dominate better death reasoning equilibra, turning it into a "farmed" unnesessary death manufaktured artifisial life situation. Nor should a "better death" "whitewash" a horrible life for the animals we kill; a problem in the Jewish calmunity⁵, where the only thing that matters to kashrut is the death and not the humane life sirkumstances of the animals we eat lifelong. In Judaism, an animal kan be treated quite horribly in ways that our ansestors would never have tolerated for their animals and as long as the killing stroke is "kosher" the animal is konsidered kosher, by most rabbinik authorities, as of yesterday at least, at least before the [Magen Tzedek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_Tzedek) or similar bekame or bekomes more popular, kommon, or standard. It was an uphill battle for the original Magen Tzedek team. In many ways, fokusing just on the death missis the vast majority of the mistreatment and maltreatment the nervous system and soul of the animals we have responsiblity⁵ for face when we take the animal out of the wilderness or wild. We kan shape sea, osean, lake, and river polisy⁵ without those added animal lives getting reklassed with farmed fish. Question for families and Family⁵: Would we be willing to pay a better life and better death premium favoring hunting, fishing, and some forms of gentle farming? The wrighter is prise-sensitive; this would have ekonomik and dietary⁵ ripple effekts. It's not a hands-down simple question. Ceteris paribus, at the same kost, it's an easy choise, but as prise pressures rise families start breaking away from a better life, better death kalmitment for other spesies we partner with and oversee dominantly.

Needs Development
-----------------
- Newsletter and alerts for valuable languistic harm reductions that get proposed and adopted; it's not functional to expect people to keep polling to check the dictionary⁵; it should push out to them if they subscribe to languistic change
- Develop a "See also" if it doesn't exist yet. I think there's a "reference" model in place, check if that meets needs and is included in word and phrase entry scripts.
