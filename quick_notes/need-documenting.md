Words / Phrases that need documenting ASAP, when time becomes available
========================================================================

✅ **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Dual definition system implemented!
The dictionary schema now supports both American Standard and Blesséd Dialekt definitions side-by-side (Rosetta Stone approach), plus usage examples and harm reduction notes. See:
- [SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md](../SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md)
- [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md](../EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md)

Note: Original concern about self-referentiality has been addressed through the dual-definition system. Each entry can now provide clarity in both American Standard (for bootstrapping) and Blesséd Dialekt (for integrated usage).

- krashless / kar
- semmelweis and semmelweis wright, right, and rite
- Blesséd number system
    - sev instead of two-syllable seven
    - ro instead of two-syllable zero, clearly distinguishable from the letter "O" (see logic of Crockford's Base 32)
    - "d" or "t" (ty) [my pronunciation varies] in place of "ten" and tens place ("four-d-one" [fourdyone] / "four-t-one" [fourtyone])
    - No irregularities between ones place numbers and tens place or any other leading numbers — not "fifty", fivedy or fivety; also not "thirty", threedy or threety instead. 
    - No irregularities in the elevens and teens (dyone/tyone = 11, dytwo/tytwo, dythree/tythree, etc. etc. up to dynine/tynine)
    - Very open to other suggestions about how to wright these number words. I'd be very happy to write fourdyone as fourTone or fourDone, with the T or D denoting and separating the tens place helpfully⁵ visually⁵.
    - "han" or "hun" for the two-syllable hundred. I prefer "han" over "hun" for this out of gratitude for the Han Zhongguoren (Chinese people), who came up with this beautifully simple foundational counting system I'm copying so heavily⁵ from
    - "thou" instead of the two-syllable thousand
    - "mill" instead of the three-syllable million (this I'm unsettled on, it's very up for debate)
    - "bill" instead of the three-syllable billion (thhis I really like, because it maps to Calmunity⁵ Legislative Bills we coordinate influential incentives and sometimes, when strictly required, coercive action around)
    - Standard International prefixes for any unit modify and adjust that unit up or down in scale, sometimes across really tremendous scales beyond typical langauge. 
        - So for instance, a µbill would be one-millionth of a bill or billion, so in the 1,000ish territory. This is useful sometimes for some kommon (common) expressive units like currency where scales jump around so much it's sometimes helpful to think in SI prefix to more easily relate the number gaps with less cognitive overhead over how separated the numbers are. If an Action is an effort that may affect a Borlaug bill (billion) of people, then a milliaction, µaction, and nano-action are more clear to those trained to quickly recognize scale shifts in SI than the equivalent unprefixed langauge. You can do the same thing with currency to make statements like, "I just reached dimillionaire / dimillaire status - I can change my fokus" or "She's a dekamillionaire / dekamillaire — she's reached and launched beyond ever-accelerating eskape velocity".

- ✅ KB (knowledge base ⇌ keyboard schema lock) - **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Keyboard Layout (KB) system implemented with versioning, known issues tracking, and integration with Knowledge Base. See [DICTIONARY_SYSTEM.md - Keyboard Layouts section](../DICTIONARY_SYSTEM.md#keyboard-layouts-kb-system)
- Laboratory (State / City⁵)
- CALM
- Calm⁴UNism
- calmplaint
- Campaign slog
- Naybor
- disneying (nayborhood pickup, fixing broken windows, esp. as guaranteed and served by rate-limiting agents)

- Steep (steep [sleep] steepens minds)
- Ængineering (including social ængineering)
- eschatological shortcutting
- friend (duty⁵ to mutual improvement; actively searching for better word post-Facebook 'friend' valence and primary meaning loosening / destruction)
- facemate (proposal for a term for true classical friend, someone we regularly⁵ spend facetime with and mutually⁵ grow with. You're not facemates with people you haven't seen for weeks or months; to be a facemate requires a certain amount of intensive calmunication and a willingness to share personal experiences for critical growth, support, study⁵, eudæmonia, and problemsolving — don't dilute, please don't tolerate marketers like Facebook diluting this term facemate; if you have an app that lists facemates those facemates should fade to being relabeled automatically as acquaintances instead if enuf time passes without true established contact. This is really important for socialization, calmunity⁵ caring, and balancing creative solitude with loneliness, especially untended loneliness, prevention; happy to provide facemate.org to any public benefit or nonprofit that's serious about promoting true, regular friendship under seriously⁵ honest Dunbar limit discussion and classifications - no one on the site should be permitted to have more than 150 facemate contacts, ever, including active acquaintances registered, and in general should be warned and resisted if going beyond Dunbar inner layers; any active acquaintance or facemate additions when you're already at 150 have to be paired with a conscious Dunbar limit acquaintance freeze / inactivity tag / drop; making room for a new facemate or active acquaintance must come at an accepted and acceptable tradeoff cost — it's not possible to be actively acquainted, in a meaningful way, with more than 150 people; influencers and calmunity⁵ connectors / leaders who intimate or suggest otherwise are generally lying or misleading to one degree or another if they act to you like they're a Dunbar friend or facemate [])
- n-counter
- dekas (dekamillionaires in American / US currency models — a substantially different species of wealth beyond millaire / millionaire that requires a word label, especially since a deka as of wrighting today at end of 02025 is equivalent to a millaire / millionare from 01966 - the klassikal 01960s word millionaire should be rereferenced deka today). At the deka level almost no one today⁵ with reasonable wants and needs wouldn't accelerate year over year thru kompounding like a plasma engine to "litespeed" and "litening" intergenerational experiences
- hektos (hektomillionaires in American / US currency models). Someone in the class of wealth of hundred+ mill is in the "hekto" wealth category⁵. Hektos with liquidity are unbelievably⁵ flexibly⁵ free if they're medically healthy⁵ and wish to be.
- frupidity (borrowed and copied from the lexicon of Amazon); frugality⁵ is a kore klassikal virtue, frupidity is its inverse where rekless frugality⁵ kauses unnecessary⁵ pennywise, pound-foolish suffering. Not offering national freely available convenient Basic Life Support training to everyone everywhere in the developed world is an example of fiscal frupidity that's killing millions of people.
- one-way door (also borrowed from the lexicon of Amazon): 
- reverse synth: the process of reverse synthesizing a life or anything else you face or are konsidering creating or synthesizing. Originally⁵ from the planning process of reverse synthesis in the "theory of change", kemistry⁵ (chemistry⁵), where you work backwards from where you want to go, your target, back to your source or present state, and not just forwards to logic your way toward creating whatever you want to create. Sometimes its easier to see the step just before you get married; if that involves a prenup, and if that prenup needs to be decided early enuf for your choice of partner to change, why not reposition to prenup in reverse synthesis to pre-proposal, in anticipation of a ring or thing? Reverse synth is extremely highly encouraged and urged for any major life action or decision, especially major gates like reaching career training, job placement, engagement, and marriage. We want to see more reverse synth in planning and linear life optimization. The proposed Pre30 site is driven by the impulse to help assist with smoothing all the important pitfalls and difficulties of reverse syth "working backward" backward engagement and dating planning logic.
- ring or thing (resisting thotless diamond ring lemming culture; amethyst hearthstone example alternative)
- µdowry (arguably a much more functional and ancient alternative to thotless diamond ring reliance - any ring selection, if You still need or want one and prioritize it as a fungible free spend, can come from fungible µdowry⁵ gift, exercise in responsible couple's future-oriented resource budgeting and bonding — but you should be free to divert the µdowry to anything, from a more experimencial honeymoon (which pays relationship dividends and reduces divorce rates) to an amazing, storyful artifact for your home like skulptural bookshelves where your souls can grow and continuously⁵ reentwine with the unique furnishments of that unique furniture). The original Blesséd author hopes Pre30 breaks and brakes down lemming diamond ring default culture. It's an indefensible waste typically on a lot of levels, especially as costs rise beyond a few han / hun dollars, and higher spending on rings is empirically⁵ correlated with _higher_ divorce rates, not longer marriages as De Beersr misleads you to believe.  It's actually a mark of bad kareactor, not good kareactor, for your partner to buy you a diamond ring, especially an expensive or natural diamong ring, without a super-deep discussion about whether it's the rite way to spend and all the alternatives and life-kompounding differences of those alternatives. There are approximately ro reasons to purchase a natural diamond anymore; all natural diamond sales should kollapse quickly⁵ from lack of any konsumer demand in any wealth kategory⁵. Not to pick on anyone, but the idea of Jeff Bezos buying Lauren Sanchez Bezos a diamond ring is, I assure you, a form of madness to Bezos _and_ Sanchez. Sanchez would have been better off receiving an additional $5 million and deciding for herself how to best spend those super-unusually large milli-dowry⁵ (mdowry⁵) funds. I suspekt she wouldn't have spent on a $5 mill (million) diamond if the funds were transferred to her and it was her free choice on what to spend that dowry⁵ on, even at that supra-stratospheric interplanetary⁵ skale of coupled "hektobill" (hektobillionaire) wealth.  I should note here when bringing up this marriage that if I had to pick a team, I'd certainly⁵ be on Team Scott, especially given the presumptive needs of the children, and separately Scott's utterly record-breaking remarkable "relentless" philanthropy⁵ and unusually⁵ empowering unrestricted-giving philanthropic model, but I really hope for the best for everyone, even in messy situations, and I don't presently⁵ have my hand forced any further than that on needing to moralize over the nature of better and best rings or things.
- "Good, better, best": A childhood rhyme. The traditional version can be improved: instead of the original, teach instead "Good, better, best: Never let them rest. Until the better get [better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213233.Better) and the good get best." In Blesséd, we want others and our facemates and family⁵ to launch past our achievement, performance, and happiness levels calmpetitively⁵. Rising tides raise all boats; let's make the better better and the good best.
- architexture (most of all in the context of choice architexture, where textual reference sources drive calmplex decision-making. Exercise your freadom whenever and wherever you can; fight and defy⁵ those who restrict your freadom)
- Freadom: The freedom to read whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want, limited only by the need to support or re:ward the creative author and the print, production, and distribution process that delivers the reading to your hands. This is a very, very fundamental freedom, perhaps the most fundamental freedom. 
- Re:ward - A more calmpleat representation of the American or King's English notion of reward. A re:ward may be a primary or secondary operant conditioner like the primary reinforces like food, steep, or even ecstatic sexual intimacy⁵, but it might also be fungible monies and budgets as a secondary operant conditioner, or interpersonal re:guard, civigious or religiously principled virtue and conscience discharge as its own re:ward, or a change in the "ward" you're scoped to be privileged to serve within. For many of us, the greatest possible re:ward is being able to serve more in either a similar or different service ward, whether that's within our family⁵ or across families, within the tite boundaries of our town, where we might be able to make the most impakt, or across those borders and boundaries, if teknology⁵ trees help re:ward us like so.
- steep: bodybrain steepening sleep. Just as tea steeps given time to rest, our bodies require a significant amount of steepening overnight. Pulling allnighters in skool is a violation of steep; it corrodes and undermines the very thing that you're seeking to attain, consolidated, steepened conscientious knowledge and wisdom. And failing to steep kills so many persons on the road from fatigued driving. While so many of us routinely do it, it's difficult at population skale to morally justify⁵ driving under a certain number of hours of steep. Sleep deprivation is a very dangerous health and safety⁵ risk. I at least hope for a more Blesséd balance of time commuting or at work versus time spent in hi-quality⁵ steep as automation progresses and a 32 hour workweek becalms more acceptably⁵ approvable and feasible in non-race industries (not in student edukation for instance).
- designer (Buckminster Fuller definition: A designer is an emerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist and evolutionary strategist.)
- ✅ Long Now Years: 02025 instead of 2025 - **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Implemented as standard date format throughout the system. See [PROMPT.md - Date Format Convention](../PROMPT.md)
- ✅ Unambiguous dates (YYYYY-MM月DD format) - **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Adopted as standard format with 月 character for unambiguous month designation. Big-endian ordering for sortability. See [PROMPT.md](../PROMPT.md)
- Ackselerate / ackceptance: Emphasizes the "ack" in acknowledgement steps in protocols in information science. The colaborative process of speeding up action _tremendously⁵_ by engaging in two-way, clear proposition, acceptance, and verification of proposed or necessary⁵ action. It operates on a "trust but verify⁵" model, where coupled responsible actors — whether natural like life partners or grouped organizations — accept a goal, agree roughly on how that goal will be reached, pitches in to get it done, and then, after it's done or seems done, everyone checks the quality⁵ of what happened: ackseleration doesn't happen without calm, conscientious quality⁵ assurance together as part of the final "ack" step, acknowledging work well-done. 
- KB: _K_nowledge _B_ase and _K_ey_b_oard. They're tightly⁵ interrelated. Our ideographic 
- A word for exercise everywhere, anywhere, to gather incidental METs thru our flows in daily⁵ life, anywhere, in coffee shops or restaurants or workplaces before or after finishing our strides. Candidate words for this right now are "hiits" (more nonreligious, high-intensity interval trainings) or "devotions" (preferred, whether I'm acting civigious religious and|or branch religious). Can be paired with metabo policy⁵ or law to raise incidental METs everywhere. This word, if well-chosen, if well-socialized as a practice, could become a lifetime achievement for anyone involved in engraining this, so hi the impact would be. It would be really lifesaving to turn weirdos, positive deviants, who exercise everywhere in public spaces, to be the norm. Other ideas for this word might be "do hiits" or "do its", mapping deliberately⁵ supportively into ubiquitous Nike "Just Do It" marketing, torquing it a bit to "Do Hiit", with me whenever I see a Nike logo or "Just Do It" or "Just Do HIIT" shirt dropping to do some situps or pushups or taking a minute or a moment to do some squats. How beautiful would it be if we could wear a swoosh or a Do Hiit shirt, walk down a few city blocks, and see naybors walking side by side break their stride and stop for a second together, drop together when they catch cite of us to do a base+bonus situps, pushups, or other plyometric exercises with impulsive devotion to health. The Nike (winged victory⁵) swoosh logos and Just Do It™ logos are already circulating worldwide; it would be amazing if we could tether into it with Just Do Hiit devotions. That would be amazing to see. I don't own any Nike gear to my knowledge, as I try to avoid brands, but for this I would _gladly_, _eagerly_ wear Nike gear periodically⁵, tuning to calmunity⁵, or especially⁵ for Gymday (which weekday?) "Just Do Hiit" starter stock habit focus. My facemate suggested the idea of third spaces, workspaces, and calmunity⁵ spaces having small options to n-courage preventative / health hiits and devotions like toe-bars or n-couragement zones, and they'd definitely be awesome and help, but devotions are their own re:ward and whether restaurants and cafés and workspaces make physical room and time for hiit or devotions you can always do them anywhere plyometrically⁵ during breaks in activity⁵. If someone told me to stop or tried discouraging me by saying I was being weird or unprofessional, I'd tell them it's a form of devotion or life prayer, and I'd push back, asking them why their spaces have to be "protected" from religious physical exertion. This should be just a definition that's not overwhelmingly long linked to a wider sociocultural/sociotechnical miracle proposal document. Josh A. and Corey came up with this idea with me on Focusmate and at a Starbucks where I was doing base+bonus devotions before every session. The practice was revived and upregulated tremendously⁵ through a Focusmate naming convention I imitated from another member who labeled their name as "Name (make me do 10+ situps+pushups)" - I adopted this as "David (make me do 10+ situps+pushups) C." which upregulated preventative incidental exercise (devotions / do hiits) so much that it became a core practice worth codifying in langauge.

- Race (default: refuse to interpret this as skin- or ancestry-based, instead discern physical or industrial or electoral race; your race being your next 5K or sport calmpetition, your most urgent pursuit in family⁵ or interfamily⁵ at or around work, or the civigious or political calmunity⁵ race that you're most likely to race to help full-court press). For a long time, I wrote and represented my race as Congressional Race Ohio 18 (OH-18), a diminished virtual imaged and imaginary⁵ at-large district after Ohio's population fell to 17 House seats. Let's not acknowledge in Blesséd other forms of race. If you want to ask about skin-tone, kin ancestry or klan, that's another thing, that's not race, that's skin-deep or genetic origin questioning, not a reflection or acceptable stereotype or summary of Your kareactor. And if you want to be skin-deep, please try to use the IC codes Great Britain uses or another friction layer imposed between sight and stereotype to eliminate or slow stereotype and stereotype threat and measurable implicit biases.
