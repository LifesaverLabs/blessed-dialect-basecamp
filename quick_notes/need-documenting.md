Words / Phrases that need documenting ASAP, when time becomes available
========================================================================
- krashless / kar
- semmelweis and semmelweis wright, right, and rite
- Blesséd number system
    - sev instead of two-syllable seven
    - ro instead of two-syllable zero, clearly distinguishable from the letter "O" (see logic of Crockford's Base 32)
    - "d" or "t" (ty) [my pronunciation varies] in place of "ten" and tens place ("four-d-one" [fourdyone] / "four-t-one" [fourtyone])
    - No irregularities between ones place numbers and tens place or any other leading numbers — not "fifty", fivedy or fivety; also not "thirty", threedy or threety instead. 
    - No irregularities in the elevens and teens (dyone/tyone = 11, dytwo/tytwo, dythree/tythree, etc. etc. up to dynine/tynine)
    - Very open to other suggestions about how to wright these number words. I'd be very happy to write fourdyone as fourTone or fourDone, with the T or D denoting and separating the tens place helpfully⁵ visually⁵.
    - "han" or "hun" for the two-syllable hundred. I prefer "han" over "hun" for this out of gratitude for the Han Zhongguoren (Chinese people), who came up with this beautifully simple foundational counting system I'm copying so heavily⁵ from
    - "thou" instead of the two-syllable thousand
    - "mill" instead of the three-syllable million (this I'm unsettled on, it's very up for debate)
    - "bill" instead of the three-syllable billion (thhis I really like, because it maps to Calmunity⁵ Legislative Bills we coordinate influential incentives and sometimes, when strictly required, coercive action around)
    - Standard International prefixes for any unit modify and adjust that unit up or down in scale, sometimes across really tremendous scales beyond typical langauge. 
        - So for instance, a µbill would be one-millionth of a bill or billion, so in the 1,000ish territory. This is useful sometimes for some kommon (common) expressive units like currency where scales jump around so much it's sometimes helpful to think in SI prefix to more easily relate the number gaps with less cognitive overhead over how separated the numbers are. If an Action is an effort that may affect a Borlaug bill (billion) of people, then a milliaction, µaction, and nano-action are more clear to those trained to quickly recognize scale shifts in SI than the equivalent unprefixed langauge. You can do the same thing with currency to make statements like, "I just reached dimillionaire / dimillaire status - I can change my fokus" or "She's a dekamillionaire / dekamillaire — she's reached and launched beyond ever-accelerating eskape velocity".

- facemate (proposal for a term for true classical friend, someone we regularly⁵ spend facetime with and mutually⁵ grow with. You're not facemates with people you haven't seen for weeks or months; to be a facemate requires a certain amount of intensive calmunication and a willingness to share personal experiences for critical growth, support, study⁵, eudæmonia, and problemsolving — don't dilute, please don't tolerate marketers like Facebook diluting this term facemate; if you have an app that lists facemates those facemates should fade to being relabeled automatically as acquaintances instead if enuf time passes without true established contact. This is really important for socialization, calmunity⁵ caring, and balancing creative solitude with loneliness, especially untended loneliness, prevention; happy to provide facemate.org to any public benefit or nonprofit that's serious about promoting true, regular friendship under seriously⁵ honest Dunbar limit discussion and classifications - no one on the site should be permitted to have more than 150 facemate contacts, ever, including active acquaintances registered, and in general should be warned and resisted if going beyond Dunbar inner layers; any active acquaintance or facemate additions when you're already at 150 have to be paired with a conscious Dunbar limit acquaintance freeze / inactivity tag / drop; making room for a new facemate or active acquaintance must come at an accepted and acceptable tradeoff cost — it's not possible to be actively acquainted, in a meaningful way, with more than 150 people; influencers and calmunity⁵ connectors / leaders who intimate or suggest otherwise are generally lying or misleading to one degree or another if they act to you like they're a Dunbar friend or facemate [])

Someone in the class of wealth of hundred+ mill is in the "hekto" wealth category⁵. Hektos with liquidity are unbelievably⁵ flexibly⁵ free if they're medically healthy⁵ and wish to be.
