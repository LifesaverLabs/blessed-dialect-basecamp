Needs Development
-----------------
- Newsletter and alerts for valuable languistic harm reductions that get proposed and adopted; it's not functional to expect people to keep polling to check the dictionary⁵; it should push out to them if they subscribe to languistic change
- Develop a "See also" if it doesn't exist yet. I think there's a "reference" model in place, check if that meets needs and is included in word and phrase entry scripts.

##### renovator (over innovator)
- The emphasis on "innovation" as some type of "out of nowhere, non-calmunity⁵ / non-strukturally⁵-integrated" funktion is a wildly poor model of what kind of inkremental and disruptive innovation aktually happens and how. Almost all aktivity⁵ kalled "innovation" is best done, and almost always needs to be done, within an existing strukture or kalmunity⁵. That's renovation, not isolated innovation. Gaining aksess to struktures where you kan renovate is one of the hardest challenges fasing renovators who kome from outside. Being understood as a renovator rather than an innovator is important to finding akseptanse in kalmunities with strong needs for wise, prudent, kareful konservation of resources and existing struktures when fased with renovation hypotheses that require kreative destruktions, espesially⁵ when there's a period of demolition for the renovation, like when a sporting goods store konsiders karefully⁵ whether and how to renovate toward exklusively supporting brain-developing youth sports and not any brain-damaging youth sports for anyone younger than, I'd argue, a Representative (25 years old). In this initial author's experimence, so much of my time was lost trying to navigate "innovator vs renovator" diskussion and dining philosopher blokades. It's easy to mistake a renovator for a kaotik, isolated innovator, and it's easy to lose sight of how important it is to site yourself in a kalmunity⁵ and strukture if you fall into identify⁵ing as an innovator instead of as a renovator. I've made that mistake also. A lot. Being able to innovate really well seems to require some deep integration into but also some kritikal distanse from existing konserved standards, but it shouldn't be so long that you're an outsider rather than inside as a full-on renovator. Relabeling innovators, innovation awards, etc. as renovators and renovation awards and kalmpetitions would really help, this author thinks, in shifting the lokus of intellektual labor back to where it belongs, kloser to and within or adjoining the struktures where change needs to happen, with launch sequenses and adaptance models that involve ankoring into deeply real existing systems rather than theoretikal, idealized kustomers and kustomizers.

##### First Responder
- In Blesséd Dialekt, you're not a first responder unless you arrive to handle emergencies in 90 seconds or less. Anything after 90 seconds is a second responder. Naybors are natural first responders; naybors can be near you nearly everywhere you ever are at all times. Second responders bring pro-level skills to time-sensitive emergencies as soon as they can but they can't get there fast enuf for a large range of fulminating, explosively time-sensitive problems: everything from the classic cardiac arrest to elderly falls to corpsers smoking a cigarette. See Naybor SOS (https://www.nayborsos.org). We're not demoting American Standard first responders to Blesséd Dialekt second responders. We're pinning response times to 90 seconds or less. If an EMT, fire, or police officer can arrive in under 90 seconds consistently, or from time to time, each time they do they'll achieve true first responder status too on that call. But generally speaking, the most highly trained emergency pros will arrive as second responders after 90 seconds pass, unless our specialization labor economics radically⁵ change, or unless we see a massive explosion in the number of trained EMTs, firefighters, and police academy⁵ trainees in the worlds we pass thru. Someday we might live in a world where everyone spends a civil service year training, among other things, to some minimal level of calmpetency in civil rights officer (police) work and emergency medical support. That's feasible if we will it and Bill it, if we debate it and agree to it in super-large social contract. Maybe then our first responder naybor will almost always be both a former civil rights officer academy⁵ trainee and a Basic Former EMT. It's curious wondering what life would be like in such a world. It would be civigious in ways that would be very important to observe and study⁵. No country⁵ has ever attempted that to my knowledge directly, but many are going thru or have gone thru the lethal military⁵ training route.

##### Moral Monopoly⁵ / Moral Monopolist: A patent holder who uses exclusivity over critical technology primarily as leverage for ethical outcomes rather than wealth extraction—attaching conditions to licensing that advance justice, safety, or care standards, while extracting only what's necessary for organizational sustainability.

---

# The Moral Monopoly Framework

This document articulates a philosophy for how patent holders of critical technologies *should* behave versus how they typically *do* behave.

## The Core Distinction

**Economic Patent Monopoly**: Using patent exclusivity to maximize profit extraction, regardless of harm to those who need the technology. The canonical examples are Mylan raising EpiPen prices from $100 to $600, and Shkreli's 5000% Daraprim increase. These are "antimoral monopolies."

**Moral Patent Monopoly⁵**: Using patent exclusivity primarily as *leverage for ethical outcomes* rather than wealth extraction—attaching conditions to licensing that advance justice, safety, or care standards, while extracting only what's necessary for organizational sustainability.

## Why This Leverage Exists

When a patent covers something truly critical—a lifesaving drug, an essential safety technology—other institutions face a trilemma:

1. License from you on your terms
2. Design around your patent (often impossible or inferior)
3. Petition government to exercise eminent domain

This creates enormous leverage. The question is: leverage *for what*?

## The Constraints on Any Monopolist

Three forces can check patent monopolies:

1. **Eminent domain**: Government can seize patents for public necessity (underutilized, in this view)
2. **Trolley Problem calculus**: When pricing becomes indefensible harm, moral and political pressure mounts
3. **Chokehold patents**: Upstream patent holders (like fundamental CRISPR patents) could constrain downstream behavior

## The Safeword Application

Lifesaver Labs' patent licensing strategy aims to demonstrate this model: push hard for safety and consent goals, but recognize limits. Specifically:

- Public acceptance defines the boundary of reasonable pressure
- Religious exceptions must exist
- The goal is *nudging* toward better outcomes, not coercion
- Overreach risks patent workarounds or eminent domain invocation

## The Ethical Imperative

The framework argues: if you hold monopoly power over something people genuinely need, you bear a moral obligation to wield it for public benefit rather than extraction—and to stay calibrated to what the public will actually accept.

There are surprisingly few moral monopolists in the historical record. The opportunity exists for patent holders of lifesaving technologies⁵ to set a different precedent.

##### Electronic Metabolic Record (EMR²) 
- The electronic medical record (EMR) is still very incalmpleat. There's a lot of missing information like exercise, diet / nutraceipt data, steep vs. sleep data, and other sensor and data inputs that needs to have a chance to be incorporated into calmprehensive preventative medical support, making up the more calmpleat next proposed layer of the Electronic Metabolic Record (EMR²) to complement and flesh out the existing Electronic Medical Record (EMR¹).

Progress Notes
--------------

✅ **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Dual definition system implemented!
The dictionary schema now supports both American Standard and Blesséd Dialekt definitions side-by-side (Rosetta Stone approach), plus usage examples and harm reduction notes. See:
- [SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md](../SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md)
- [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md](../EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md)

Note: Original concern about self-referentiality has been addressed through the dual-definition system. Each entry can now provide clarity in both American Standard (for bootstrapping) and Blesséd Dialekt (for integrated usage).
