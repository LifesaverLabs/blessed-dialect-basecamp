Additional Blesséd words / phrases
-----------------------------------
- key safeword library⁵: grue, graylight, man:go, stop stop / no no and Zelda's triforce no (stop stop stop / no no no)[Nintendo please support don't sue], red light, skramble (get out now, skrambled sekret enforcement)
- Suggestion æmergent from Claude session on nikotine adiktion: "finankal" konsequences. Bridges the notion of "finanse" and "kalendar" or "kalorie". Maybe there's another dekomposition too in finan-k-al, like finan-kalm-all. Must think of this more; it would be really valuable to story⁵ and spacetime periodikally⁵ finankal planning. Like the lesson that "financial" planning has no meaning if it's not kalendared and kalming to all involved. I'm struggling to find and story⁵ the other "kal" (kalorie) konnektion I kould imagine teachers making but that's perhaps for lack of kreative imagination.
- mortal library⁵: see mortallibrary.org when launched. Drug resisdænce.
- resisdænce: A choreographed resistance that any part of a kouple kan engage in, or that the pair together as a dualindiv kan perform and enjoy⁵. Reformats resistance as a social dance, which is more konsistent with our natures.
- (Marathon / Marathoner / M.) Lastname: A gender-neutral honorific appelation for a person in a professional or personal context that doesn't require knowledge about that person's marital status like "Ms." and "Mrs." require.  "M" attaches to the notion of "Marathon" or "Moral Marathoner", the notion that each of us has our own lifelong extended moral marathon that we're running in our lives. When a female or male officer of a law enforcement agency writes me, I need to be able to reply back without presuming their marital status, and in a way that respects and honors them for their marathoning nature and work. Same in corporations and all walks of calmunity⁵ life. As an example, the author does not want to be called "Mr. Clayman"; he strongly prefers "Marathon Clayman". My future spouse would have a similar designation, but perhaps a different or joint last name, or I might join her on her family name; it depends on how we decide that question. On that question, I'm in favor of flipping a five-optioned pseudorandom generator; using the very most common last name in USAT as an example for spousal naming: Smith, Clayman, Smith-Clayman, Clayman-Smith, or Smithman. Clayith doesn't make sense. And all these last name options would probably flip over to Klayman to meet Blesséd spelling standards. Whatever the last name, the ideal title I'd say would be Marathon or Marathoner.
- Wonderbar: An expression saying that you've hit a wonderous, amazing level, even if it's the standard bar. So, for instance, if you set a goal of a base of 10 pushups in Just Do Hiit, and you hit your 10 pushups, even if you don't do extra bonus beyond that's "wonderbar" bekause you hit your "entry bar" goal. Even more so if you surpass it and hit a new level you've never hit before. Inspired from Deutsche "wunderbar". Etymology: "wonder" + "bar", where bar has the meaning of a threshold standard. If you have a habit of jogging or running in three 5 minute sprints + bonus, even if you don't run any extra bonus if you hit all three 5-minute sprints that's wonderbar, and the rest is bonus. And if you go back and run three 6-minute sprints the next time, and make that your new standard, when adopted as your standard that then becomes your new wonderbar level and you can push forward for bonus beyond. From this author's point-of-view, in school, a flat A is the wonderbar. Anything less isn't wonderbar. A+ is bonus excellence, tho some tiger grandparents and parents push harder for A+ to be the wonderbar standard. A- might be said to be the bar. Anything below an A- is below the bar and probabilistikally⁵ leads to worse eventual klass levels, tho not always — sometimes grandstudents beat the odds and show ekseptional merit in other ways in their lives. Grades kan only be fraktionally differentiated; they're not final final.
- grandstudent: A student who is trying to klimb the generations and bekome more sage, klimbing beyond their kronologikal age, with the help of their whole family⁵ and Family⁵ tree — saging students reach "grandstudent" status. Similar in some ways and inspired by "grandmaster" in chess, and the kounterpart to grandparent; grandstudents look ahead to being parents and grandparents themselves and work to reverse synthesize in stable stages their lives, aksepting the unsertainty of stages beyond strongly achieved intermediates and being ready to branch or fork in other direktions if their synth and|or reverse synth changes. There good, better, best should be a grandparent-grandstudent-teacher assosiation (GGSTA or similar), where grandparents, parents, students, and grandstudents would feel welkome and have a chanse to koördinate. There are many grandparents who would love to be an aktive part of their grandstudents' edukations and right now they're exkluded from konversation and partisipation in skooling.

Blesséd Number System
---------------------
- "d" or "t" (ty) [my pronunciation varies] in place of "ten" and tens place ("four-d-one" [fourdyone] / "four-t-one" [fourtyone])
- No irregularities between ones place numbers and tens place or any other leading numbers — not "fifty", fivedy or fivety; also not "thirty", threedy or threety instead.
- No irregularities in the elevens and teens (dyone/tyone = 11, dytwo/tytwo, dythree/tythree, etc. etc. up to dynine/tynine)
- Very open to other suggestions about how to wright these number words. I'd be very happy to write fourdyone as fourTone or fourDone, with the T or D denoting and separating the tens place helpfully⁵ visually⁵.
- Standard International prefixes for any unit modify and adjust that unit up or down in scale, sometimes across really tremendous scales beyond typical langauge.



Relationships, Intimacy, and Kalmunity⁵
---------------------------------------

- Stubborn sexuality


Health and Wellness
-------------------

- Heartclot / Healthclot
- Quit grit


Additional Stubs needing more basic klarifikation
-----------------------------------------------

- Race (default: refuse to interpret this as skin- or ancestry-based, instead discern physical or industrial or electoral race; your race being your next 5K or sport calmpetition, your most urgent pursuit in family⁵ or interfamily⁵ at or around work, or the civigious or political calmunity⁵ race that you're most likely to race to help full-court press). For a long time, I wrote and represented my race as Congressional Race Ohio 18 (OH-18), a diminished virtual imaged and imaginary⁵ at-large district after Ohio's population fell to 17 House seats. Let's not acknowledge in Blesséd other forms of race. If you want to ask about skin-tone, kin ancestry or klan, that's another thing, that's not race, that's skin-deep or genetic origin questioning, not a reflection or acceptable stereotype or summary of Your kareactor. And if you want to be skin-deep, please try to use the IC codes Great Britain uses or another friction layer imposed between sight and stereotype to eliminate or slow stereotype and stereotype threat and measurable implicit biases.
- Thoughtfulness ranges: what calmunity⁴⁵ / kalmunity⁴⁵ means vs say kalmunity²³⁴. There are a lot of situations in life where you don't want to be philosophizing for too long due to short-akting needs, where earlier authority²³⁴ may be needed. Final justifications¹ kan even be final and nonarguable at one why or aspekt. It depends on the situation and prinsiple that's at stake.
- Wheren: Where and when, with "whenabouts / whereabouts" expressive default kareakter. "Wheren do you want to meet? Have a spacetime in mind?" Another expressive alternative to trigger and diskuss spacetime planning.
- "better death" and "better life" hunting: When the lethal method of hunting or fishing is more painless and quik and better dedikated (as much flesh as possible used) than the likely death distribution the organism would face in the wild. It's going to be to some extent species and region-spesifik. While it may akselerate death, it is a more humane (painless, quik, respektful, useful) stokastik end to the organism's life. It's the kind of death a Native American would wish on those organisms they hunt. An example of an ethiks gap this opens klearly⁵ would be between wild fishing and farm fishing. In wild fishing, the death is akselerated but the fish would have to die eventually in nature one way or another, whereas in wild fishing the life and death is manufaktured and the death was always unnesessary⁵; there is no natural death distribution to fairly match the organism to bekause its life kourse wouldn't have even begun without the artifisial mekanisms and kontrols of farmed fishing; the life of the fish doesn't fit into the natural karrying kapasity⁵ of the oseans, seas, lakes, or rivers. You kan not use a likely death distribution from nature and apply it to a farmed animal klaiming "better death" humane treatment — that's analogikally⁵ like giving birth to a fetal baby in an antiseptik, highly konditioned, unnatural laboratory⁵ only for the purposes of killing it in a unnatural lab. This wrighter does not typikally distinguish or much kare about the difference between "artifisial" and "natural" kemikals, but when it komes to life there's a much greater duty⁵ to distinguish between artifisially engineered life starts with the purpose of flesh-harvest and hunting and fishing to akselerate with better death natural populations. This has reasonability⁵ limits. The wrighter has no issues with land management and resource management polisies by Fish and Wildlife Departments to assist along natural population growth in nature to raise, for instance, deer populations by kulling wolves. That doesn't in this wrighter's view dominate better death reasoning equilibra, turning it into a "farmed" unnesessary death manufaktured artifisial life situation. Nor should a "better death" "whitewash" a horrible life for the animals we kill; a problem in the Jewish calmunity⁵, where the only thing that matters to kashrut is the death and not the humane life sirkumstances of the animals we eat lifelong. In Judaism, an animal kan be treated quite horribly in ways that our ansestors would never have tolerated for their animals and as long as the killing stroke is "kosher" the animal is konsidered kosher, by most rabbinik authorities, as of yesterday at least, at least before the [Magen Tzedek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_Tzedek) or similar bekame or bekomes more popular, kommon, or standard. It was an uphill battle for the original Magen Tzedek team. In many ways, fokusing just on the death missis the vast majority of the mistreatment and maltreatment the nervous system and soul of the animals we have responsiblity⁵ for face when we take the animal out of the wilderness or wild. We kan shape sea, osean, lake, and river polisy⁵ without those added animal lives getting reklassed with farmed fish. Question for families and Family⁵: Would we be willing to pay a better life and better death premium favoring hunting, fishing, and some forms of gentle farming? The wrighter is prise-sensitive; this would have ekonomik and dietary⁵ ripple effekts. It's not a hands-down simple question. Ceteris paribus, at the same kost, it's an easy choise, but as prise pressures rise families start breaking away from a better life, better death kalmitment for other spesies we partner with and oversee dominantly.

Needs Development
-----------------

- Semmelspan — (see Semmelspan Kompleks) — needs its own standalone entry or cross-reference
- Newsletter and alerts for valuable languistic harm reductions that get proposed and adopted; it's not functional to expect people to keep polling to check the dictionary⁵; it should push out to them if they subscribe to languistic change
- Develop a "See also" if it doesn't exist yet. I think there's a "reference" model in place, check if that meets needs and is included in word and phrase entry scripts.


Progress Notes
--------------

✅ **COMPLETED 02024-12月12**: Dual definition system implemented!
The dictionary schema now supports both American Standard and Blesséd Dialekt definitions side-by-side (Rosetta Stone approach), plus usage examples and harm reduction notes. See:
