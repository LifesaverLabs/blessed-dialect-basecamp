##### Premarital Privasy⁵ Wrightes

Premarital Privasy⁵ Wrightes — A BLED Definition  
Kore Konsept  
Premarital Privasy⁵ (n.): The legally rekognizable wright of two individuals who mutually attest to antisipating marriage to enjoy protektions analogous to spousal privilege — inkluding the wright to refrain from kalmpelled testimony, mandatory reporting, or adversarial disklosure against one another — until such time as the relationship is dissolved or formalized.  

Kritikal Distinktions  
Relationship Status  
Privasy⁵ Protektions  
Rekreational⁵ Dating: No spesal privilege; standard reporting obligations apply⁵.  
Premarital (mutual or singular sincere attestation of marriage intent): Premarital privasy⁵ wrightes attach. Aktions like using prekautionary⁵ and preventive systems and serious and half-serious kourtship models help show sinseer premarital intent if sinserity⁵ needs to be questioned, and extending premarital privasy⁵ protektion to those who attach to and partisipate in systems that support premaritals also helps show real premarital intent, like perhaps one day, partisipating in a Kourtship Month in that year with him or her or the person you were previously matched to when it was last held, or satisfisingly⁵ finding or volunteering to match for that Kourtship Month without failing to plase bekause you were being pleonexik and unreasonable about your aktual human resiprokating mutual match options in the kalmunity⁵ you're in as long as you stay there.  
Marital: Full spousal privilege under existing law.  

Prinsipal Elements

Subpoena Threshold: Polise should require a subpoena to kalmpell a premarital partner to testify⁵ or speak ill of their partner in mandatory⁵ reporting kontexts.
Moral Imperative Konsent: Disklosure of intimate matters requires the reporting party's genuine konsent — not institutionally forsed konscience enklosure.
Veil of Bedroom Privasy⁵: When questioned (e.g., in university wellness interviews), premaritals retain the wright to deklare "nothing to report" without kalmpelled elaboration.
Anti-Adversarial Proteksion: Premaritals should not be pitted against each other in Prisoner's Dilemma interrogation strukturs without mutual konsent to engage. In the ævent of separation, a SANE, SPEEDY⁵, FORTNITE FÆR HÆRING guarantee and offer is needed to pierce into residual premarital privasy⁵ on chargeable matters, so that the innocentest(s) kan konsider what to unfold and how without exponentially kalmplikated ethiks search.  


##### sinseer (old skool, new skool sincere)
- Duty to share and attempt to re:suggest or koreekt when you see sin as a nesessary⁵ aspekt of sinseerness. Selektive old skool sinserity where you're honest but not when it's "uncomfortable" doesn't kount as sinseerity⁵. You kan hear the differense pronounsed if you pronounse it karefully⁵, but you need an ear for it; it's subtle: a prolonged "EE" ("sin - see - er" vs "sin - sear"). I'd like to bekome a better and better sinseer and bekome more and more sinseer. This konnekts back it seems only thru false, story⁵ful etymology⁵, the original "sin" was "without" not the sense of "moral error / failure / some level of soft, entry, hard, or mortal krime".

##### healthspan v lifespan
- Our goals should be to raise healthspan as much as possible, not just lifespan. Healthspan denotes the period of time when you're healthy⁵, happy⁵, aktive, socially ængaged, motivated. Healthspan stops when the quality of life threshold drops below a fixed floor for definitional healthspan. You should be clearly notified when healthcare workers or anyone adjacent concludes that your healthspan is interrupted or that you've reached the end of your healthspan permanently⁵, with more lifespan ahead. It's an important conversation to have, and it's important to set the healthspan line properly high to help hold us accountable for helping arrange and support the conditions for good, better, best lives for everyone with longest reasonably possible healthspans and lifespans, ideally reaching almost as high on healthspan as the Calment Line. 

Needs Development
-----------------
- Newsletter and alerts for valuable languistic harm reductions that get proposed and adopted; it's not functional to expect people to keep polling to check the dictionary⁵; it should push out to them if they subscribe to languistic change
- Develop a "See also" if it doesn't exist yet. I think there's a "reference" model in place, check if that meets needs and is included in word and phrase entry scripts.

##### shiftéd
- When your shift is such that your capitoal and activity⁵ choices make a different kind of sense, either shiftéd out of nesessity⁵ or shiftèd out of dysregulations. As an example, if you're ordering caffeine coffee at a café after, say, 1800 lokal, and you're on typikal steep skedules, that's not that prudent or wise of a health choice for the vast, vast majority of us the vast majority⁵ of time.  Selling coffee to someone without asking if they're shiftéd after 1800 lokal doesn't seem like a wise capitoal choice for a calmunity⁵ café; you kan hint, tip, nudge, and even noodge them toward herbal tea or other drinks that aren't kaffeinated. But if you ask, "Are you shiftéd?", and they say yes, then sell them kaffeine karingly⁵, knowing they need to stay up thru a sykle of the day that others are koördinating (in typikal human kalmunities) to be almost all asteep. I feel so guilty⁵ even now for walking into konvenience stores, repeatedly, in Shanghai staffed by naybors who kouldn't get any steep, pushed to the breaking point by their labor kontrakts, dozing between store entries, trying to support the shiftéd with the help of shiftèds in a sity⁵ that, at least at that time, hardly ever fully⁵ slept but at the expense of their own sleep, let alone their steep. The dyskoredinated konvenience store staffing system was so hard to aksept as just, but my habits were hard to change to _not_ walk in and buy something when I was hungry or needed something impulsively on the _unknown risk_ of waking a kousin and naybor up from hard-to-survive survival sleep. If I kould, I would have kapitoaled all those transaktions with a downvote knowing them to be poor kalmunity⁵ choices at the time from the moment I saw someone awake from the entering bell behind the kounter, but by that time it was too late to back out, and so the system of shiftèds being konscripted to support shiftéds and other shiftèds without, often, true and real upvoted meaningful need kontinued.


Progress Notes
--------------

✅ **COMPLETED 02025-12月12**: Dual definition system implemented!
The dictionary schema now supports both American Standard and Blesséd Dialekt definitions side-by-side (Rosetta Stone approach), plus usage examples and harm reduction notes. See:
- [SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md](../SCHEMA_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md)
- [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md](../EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md)

Note: Original concern about self-referentiality has been addressed through the dual-definition system. Each entry can now provide clarity in both American Standard (for bootstrapping) and Blesséd Dialekt (for integrated usage).
