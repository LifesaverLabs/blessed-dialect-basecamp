# Blesséd Dialect Basecamp

An experimental branch of American langauge, evolving toward increased harmlessness and human flourishing.

## What is Blesséd Dialect?

**Blesséd Dialect** is a B⁵leading edge langauge project—unstable, rapid, and consensus-driven. We're evolving langauge to help humanity reach deep wellbeing goals: specifically, helping everyone reach the 100 and 120 year milestones by the end of this century.

The name "Blesséd" is short for **Borlaug Less Éd**—the aspirational state when we've achieved sufficient longevity that we can focus less intensively on life preservation. Until then, we must **Borlaug more** together.

## Core Concepts

- **Borlaug** (verb) - To preserve and extend life, named after Norman Borlaug whose work saved a billion and growing
- **Calmunity⁵** - Community with emphasis on calm collaboration and exponential collective power thru (through) steady, welcome "five why" questioning in calmunity⁵ life
- **Blesséd / Borlaug Less Éd** - The finish line when everyone reaches longevity goals (100-120 years). We have no current plans to extend life any further past 120. At 120, the primary goal would be to turn toward the relief of Borlauging less, not more. All stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end. All life must come to an end.

## License

This project is open source and available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. The dialect itself is a collective effort—language belongs to those who speak it.

## Our Mission

Blesséd Dialect is an extension of "English for Humans" and "American for Humans"—language that prioritizes people over convention. Through your contributions, we shape langauge that helps us reach deep human wellbeing.

**Our goal:** Help everyone reach 100 and 120 years by the end of this century through langauge evolution that reduces harm and extends life.

## Get Involved

- **Explore** the Dictionary to learn existing terms
- **Join** the Forum to propose new langauge
- **Read** the About page to understand our mission
- **Contribute** code, ideas, or feedback—all are equally valuable

## Governance

Currently, editorial rights rest with the original Blesséd author. As our calmunity⁵ grows and diversifies, governance will evolve toward consensus and quorum management by an editorial board willing to morph langauge radically⁵ for human needs.

**Welcome to the bleeding B⁵leading edge.** Together, we're creating langauge that serves life itself. Your voice matters here. 🌱

*This is experimental langauge evolution—unstable, rapid, consensus-driven. Changes happen when needs appear. Not all langauge is well-tested; it just needs to show promise.*
