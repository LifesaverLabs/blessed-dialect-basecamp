# AI Assistant Prompt Guidelines for Blessed Dialect Basecamp

## Date Format Convention

**CRITICAL: All dates must use the Long Now Foundation format with Blesséd Dialekt月 notation:**

Format: `YYYYY-MM月DD`

- 5-digit years (prepend leading zero to 4-digit years)
- Two-digit month followed by the 月 (moon/month) character
- Two-digit day
- Big-endian ordering (most significant to least significant)

### Examples:
- ❌ Wrong: `2024-12-01`
- ✅ Correct: `02024-12月01`

- ❌ Wrong: `2024-01-15`
- ✅ Correct: `02024-01月15`

### Rationale:
1. **Year 10K compliance**: Following Long Now Foundation's 5-digit year system to avoid Y10K problem
2. **Unambiguous ordering**: Big-endian format eliminates MM/DD vs DD/MM confusion
3. **Cultural bridge**: 月 character connects English dates to international (especially East Asian) linguistic context
4. **Kinetic expression**: The 月 symbol adds symbolic richness while maintaining readability

### Note:
This format is subject to evolution based on calmunity⁵ consensus, but represents the current best-known model for date representation in the Blesséd Dialekt ecosystem.
